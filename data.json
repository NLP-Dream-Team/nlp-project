Zombie it is.\n\nZombie.js is a lightweight framework for testing client-side JavaScript code in\na simulated environment.  No browser required.\n\nLet's try to sign up to a page and see what happens:\n\n```js\nconst Browser = require('zombie');\n\n// We're going to make requests to http://example.com/signup\n// Which will be routed to our test server localhost:3000\nBrowser.localhost('example.com', 3000);\n\ndescribe('User visits signup page', function() {\n\n  const browser = new Browser();\n\n  before(function(done) {\n    browser.visit('/signup', done);\n  });\n\n  describe('submits form', function() {\n\n    before(function(done) {\n      browser.fill('email', 'zombie@underworld.dead')\n      .then(() => browser.fill('password', 'eat-the-living'))\n      .then(() => browser.pressButton('Sign Me Up!', done));\n    });\n\n    it('should be successful', function() {\n      browser.assert.success();\n    });\n\n    it('should see welcome page', function() {\n      browser.assert.text('title', 'Welcome To Brains Depot');\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis example uses the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing\nframework, but Zombie will work with other testing frameworks.  Since Mocha\nsupports promises, we can also write the test like this:\n\n```js\nconst Browser = require('zombie');\n\n// We're going to make requests to http://example.com/signup\n// Which will be routed to our test server localhost:3000\nBrowser.localhost('example.com', 3000);\n\ndescribe('User visits signup page', function() {\n\n  const browser = new Browser();\n\n  before(function() {\n    return browser.visit('/signup');\n  });\n\n  describe('submits form', function() {\n\n    before(function() {\n      return browser.fill('email', 'zombie@underworld.dead')\n      .then(() => browser.fill('password', 'eat-the-living'))\n      .then(() => browser.pressButton('Sign Me Up!'));\n    });\n\n    it('should be successful', function() {\n      browser.assert.success();\n    });\n\n    it('should see welcome page', function() {\n      browser.assert.text('title', 'Welcome To Brains Depot');\n    });\n  });\n\n});\n```\n\nWell, that was easy.\n\n\n**WARNING:**  Crawling untrusted web pages with Zombie.js is not safe.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Installing](#installing)\n* [Browser](#browser)\n* [Assertions](#assertions)\n* [Cookies](#cookies)\n* [Tabs](#tabs)\n* [Debugging](#debugging)\n* [Events](#events)\n* [Resources](#resources)\n* [Pipeline](#pipeline)\n\n\n\n\n## Installing\n\nTo install Zombie.js you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):\n\n```bash\n$ npm install zombie --save-dev\n```\n\n\n\n## Browser\n\n#### browser.assert\n\nMethods for making assertions against the browser, such as\n`browser.assert.element('.foo')`.\n\nSee [Assertions](#assertions) for detailed discussion.\n\n#### browser.referer\n\nYou can use this to set the HTTP Referer header.\n\n#### browser.resources\n\nAccess to history of retrieved resources.  See [Resources](#resources) for\ndetailed discussion.\n\n#### browser.pipeline\n\nAccess to the pipeline for making requests and processing responses.  Use this\nto add new request/response handlers the pipeline for a single browser instance,\nor use `Pipeline.addHandler` to modify all instances.  See\n[Pipeline](#pipeline).\n\n\n#### browser.tabs\n\nArray of all open tabs (windows).  Allows you to operate on more than one open\nwindow at a time.\n\nSee [Tabs](#tabs) for detailed discussion.\n\n#### browser.proxy\n\nThe `proxy` option takes a URL so you can tell Zombie what protocol, host and\nport to use.  Also supports Basic authentication, e.g.:\n\n```js\nbrowser.proxy = 'http://me:secret@myproxy:8080'\n```\n\n#### browser.attach(selection, filename, callback)\n\nAttaches a file to the specified input field.  The second argument is the file name.\ncallback - called with error or nothing.\n\n#### browser.back([callback])\n\nNavigate to the previous page in history.  Returns the zombie.browser.Browser to allow \nfunction chaining.\n\n#### browser.body\n\nReturns a zombie.dom.DOMNode representing the body element of the current document.\n\n#### browser.check(selector, [callback])\n\nChecks a checkbox.  If called without a callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.choose(selector, [callback])\n\nselects a radio box option.  If called without a callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.clickLink(selector, callback)\n\nClicks on a link.  Clicking on a link can trigger other events, load new page, etc.  Use a \ncallback to be notified of completion.  Finds link by text content or selector.  \n\n#### browser.dump([output])\n\nDump information to the console: Zombie version, current URL, history, cookies, event loop,\netc.  Useful for debugging and submitting error reports. `output` defaults to \n`process.stdout`.\n\n#### browser.evaluate(code, filename)\n\nEvaluates a JavaScript expression in the context of the current window and returns the\nresult.  When evaluating external script, also include filename.\n\nYou can also use this to evaluate a function in the context of the window: for timers and \nasynchronous callbacks (e.g. XHR).\n\n#### browser.field(selector)\n\nFind and return an input field (`INPUT`, `TEXTAREA` or `SELECT`) based on a CSS selector, \nfield name (its `name` attribute) or the text value of a label associated with that field \n(case sensitive, but ignores leading/trailing spaces).\n\n#### browser.fill(selector, value, [callback])\n\nFill in an input field or text area with the provided value. If called without a callback,\nreturns a promise.\n\n#### browser.fire(selector, eventName, [callback])\n\nFire a DOM event.  You can use this to simulate a DOM event, e.g. clicking\na link.  These events will bubble up and can be cancelled.  Like `wait`\nthis method takes an optional callback.  If called without a callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.link(selector)\n\nFinds and returns a link by its text content or selector.\n\n#### browser.load(html, [callback])\n\nLoads the HTML, processes events and calls the callback.  Without a callback, returns a \npromise.\n\n#### browser.location\n\nReturn the location of the current document (same as `window.location`).\n\n#### browser.pressButton(selector, [callback])\n\nPress a button (button element or input of type `submit`).  Typically this will submit the \nform.  Use the callback to wait for the from submission, page to load and all events run \ntheir course.\n\n#### browser.query(selector, [context])\n\nEvaluates the CSS selector against the document (or context node) and return an element.  \n`context` defaults to `document`.\n\n#### browser.queryAll(selector, [context])\n\nEvaluates the CSS selector against the document (or context node) and return array of nodes.\n`context` defaults to `document`.\n\n#### browser.querySelector(selector)\n\nSelects the first matching element and returns it.\n\n#### browser.redirected\n\nReturns True if the page request followed a redirect.\n\n#### browser.reload()\n\nReloads the current page.  Returns the zombie.browser.Browser to allow function chaining.\n\n#### browser.select(selector, value, [callback])\n\nSelects an option inside of `selector` with given `value`. If called without a callback, \nreturns a promise.\n\n#### browser.selectOption(selector, [callback])\n\nSelects an option.\n\n#### browser.status\n\nReturns the status code returned for this window (200, 303, etc). The same as \n`browser.statusCode`\n\n#### browser.success\n\nReturn true if last response had status code 200 .. 299\n\n#### browser.text(selector, [context])\n\nReturns the text contents of the selected elements.  `context` defaults to document.\n\n#### browser.uncheck(selector, [callback])\n\nUnchecks a checkbox. If called without a callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.unselect(selector, value, [callback])\n\nUnselects an option. If called without a callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.unselectOption(selector, [callback])\n\nUnselects the an option. If called without a callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.visit(url, options, [callback])\n\nLoads document from the specified URL, processes events and calls the callback, or returns a \npromise.\n\n#### browser.click(selector, [callback])\n\nClick on the selected element.  If called without callback, returns a promise.\n\n#### browser.errors\n\nCollection of errors accumulated by the browser while loading page and executing\nscripts.\n\n#### browser.source\n\nReturns a string of the source HTML from the last response.\n\n#### browser.html(element)\n\nReturns a string of HTML for a selected HTML element. If argument `element` is `undefined`, \nthe function returns a string of the source HTML from the last response.\n\nExample uses:\n\n```js\nbrowser.html('div');\nbrowser.html('div#contain');\nbrowser.html('.selector');\nbrowser.html();\n```\n\n#### Browser.localhost(host, port)\n\nAllows you to make requests against a named domain and HTTP/S port, and will\nroute it to the test server running on localhost and unprivileged port.\n\nFor example, if you want to call your application \"example.com\", and redirect\ntraffic from port 80 to the test server that's listening on port 3000, you can\ndo this:\n\n```js\nBrowser.localhost('example.com', 3000)\nbrowser.visit('/path', function() {\n  console.log(browser.location.href);\n});\n=> 'http://example.com/path'\n```\n\nThe first time you call `Browser.localhost`, if you didn't specify\n`Browser.site`, it will set it to the hostname (in the above example,\n\"example.com\").  Whenever you call `browser.visit` with a relative URL, it\nappends it to `Browser.site`, so you don't need to repeat the full URL in every\ntest case.\n\nYou can use wildcards to map domains and all hosts within these domains, and you\ncan specify the source port to map protocols other than HTTP.  For example:\n\n```js\n// HTTP requests for example.test www.example.test will be answered by localhost\n// server running on port 3000\nBrowser.localhost('*.example.test', 3000);\n// HTTPS requests will be answered by localhost server running on port 3001\nBrowser.localhost('*.example.test:443', 3001);\n```\n\nThe underlying implementation hacks `net.Socket.connect`, so it will route any\nTCP connection made by the Node application, whether Zombie or any other\nlibrary.  It does not affect other processes running on your machine.\n\n### Browser.extend\n\nYou can use this to customize new browser instances for your specific needs.\nThe extension function is called for every new browser instance, and can change\nproperties, bind methods, register event listeners, etc.\n\n```js\nBrowser.extend(function(browser) {\n  browser.on('console', function(level, message) {\n    logger.log(message);\n  });\n  browser.on('log', function(level, message) {\n    logger.log(message);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Assertions\n\nTo make life easier, Zombie introduces a set of convenience assertions that you\ncan access directly from the browser object.  For example, to check that a page\nloaded successfully:\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.success();\nbrowser.assert.text('title', 'My Awesome Site');\nbrowser.assert.element('#main');\n```\n\nThese assertions are available from the `browser` object since they operate on a\nparticular browser instance -- generally dependent on the currently open window,\nor document loaded in that window.\n\nMany assertions require an element/elements as the first argument, for example,\nto compare the text content (`assert.text`), or attribute value\n(`assert.attribute`).  You can pass one of the following values:\n\n- An HTML element or an array of HTML elements\n- A CSS selector string (e.g. \"h2\", \".book\", \"#first-name\")\n\nMany assertions take an expected value and compare it against the actual value.\nFor example, `assert.text` compares the expected value against the text contents\nof one or more strings.  The expected value can be one of:\n\n- A JavaScript primitive value (string, number)\n- `undefined` or `null` are used to assert the lack of value\n- A regular expression\n- A function that is called with the actual value and returns true if the\n  assertion is true\n- Any other object will be matched using `assert.deepEqual`\n\nNote that in some cases the DOM specification indicates that lack of value is an\nempty string, not `null`/`undefined`.\n\nAll assertions take an optional last argument that is the message to show if the\nassertion fails.  Better yet, use a testing framework like\n[Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) that has good diff support and\ndon't worry about these messages.\n\n\n### Available Assertions\n\nThe following assertions are available:\n\n#### assert.attribute(selection, name, expected, message)\n\nAsserts the named attribute of the selected element(s) has the expected value.\n\nFails if no element found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.attribute('form', 'method', 'post');\nbrowser.assert.attribute('form', 'action', '/customer/new');\n// Disabled with no attribute value, i.e. <button disabled>\nbrowser.assert.attribute('button', 'disabled', '');\n// No disabled attribute i.e. <button>\nbrowser.assert.attribute('button', 'disabled', null);\n```\n\n#### assert.className(selection, className, message)\n\nAsserts that selected element(s) has that and only that class name.  May also be\nspace-separated list of class names.\n\nFails if no element found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.className('form input[name=email]', 'has-error');\n```\n\n#### assert.cookie(identifier, expected, message)\n\nAsserts that a cookie exists and  has the expected value, or if `expected` is\n`null`, that no such cookie exists.\n\nThe identifier is either the name of a cookie, or an object with the property\n`name` and the optional properties `domain` and `path`.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.cookie('flash', 'Missing email address');\n```\n\n#### assert.element(selection, message)\n\nAsserts that one element matching selection exists.\n\nFails if no element or more than one matching element are found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.element('form');\nbrowser.assert.element('form input[name=email]');\nbrowser.assert.element('form input[name=email].has-error');\n```\n\n#### assert.elements(selection, count, message)\n\nAsserts how many elements exist in the selection.\n\nThe argument `count` can be a number, or an object with the following\nproperties:\n\n- `atLeast` - Expecting to find at least that many elements\n- `atMost`  - Expecting to find at most that many elements\n- `exactly` - Expecting to find exactly that many elements\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.elements('form', 1);\nbrowser.assert.elements('form input', 3);\nbrowser.assert.elements('form input.has-error', { atLeast: 1 });\nbrowser.assert.elements('form input:not(.has-error)', { atMost: 2 });\n```\n\n#### assert.evaluate(expression, expected, message)\n\nEvaluates the JavaScript expression in the context of the currently open window.\n\nWith one argument, asserts that the value is equal to `true`.\n\nWith two/three arguments, asserts that the returned value matches the expected\nvalue.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.evaluate('$(\"form\").data(\"valid\")');\nbrowser.assert.evaluate('$(\"form\").data(\"errors\").length', 3);\n```\n\n#### assert.global(name, expected, message)\n\nAsserts that the global (window) property has the expected value.\n\n#### assert.hasClass(selection, className, message)\n\nAsserts that selected element(s) have the expected class name.  Elements may\nhave other class names (unlike `assert.className`).\n\nFails if no element found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.hasClass('form input[name=email]', 'has-error');\n```\n\n#### assert.hasFocus(selection, message)\n\nAsserts that selected element has the focus.\n\nIf the first argument is `null`, asserts that no element has the focus.\n\nOtherwise, fails if element not found, or if more than one element found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.hasFocus('form input:nth-child(1)');\n```\n\n#### assert.hasNoClass(selection, className, message)\n\nAsserts that selected element(s) does not have the expected class name.  Elements may\nhave other class names (unlike `assert.className`).\n\nFails if no element found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.hasNoClass('form input', 'has-error');\n```\n\n#### assert.input(selection, expected, message)\n\nAsserts that selected input field(s) (`input`, `textarea`, `select` etc) have\nthe expected value.\n\nFails if no element found.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.input('form input[name=text]', 'Head Eater');\n```\n\n#### assert.link(selection, text, url, message)\n\nAsserts that at least one link exists with the given selector, text and URL.\nThe selector can be `a`, but a more specific selector is recommended.\n\nURL can be relative to the current document, or a regular expression.\n\nFails if no element is selected that also has the specified text content and\nURL.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.link('footer a', 'Privacy Policy', '/privacy');\n```\n\n#### assert.redirected(message)\n\nAsserts the browser was redirected when retrieving the current page.\n\n#### assert.success(message)\n\nAsserts the current page loaded successfully (status code 2xx or 3xx).\n\n#### assert.status(code, message)\n\nAsserts the current page loaded with the expected status code.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.status(404);\n```\n\n#### assert.style(selection, style, expected, message)\n\nAsserts that selected element(s) have the expected value for the named style\nproperty.  For example:\n\nFails if no element found, or element style does not match expected value.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.style('#show-hide.hidden', 'display', 'none');\nbrowser.assert.style('#show-hide:not(.hidden)', 'display', '');\n```\n\n#### assert.text(selection, expected, message)\n\nAsserts that selected element(s) have the expected text content.  For example:\n\nFails if no element found that has that text content.\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.text('title', 'My Awesome Page');\n```\n\n#### assert.url(url, message)\n\nAsserts the current page has the expected URL.\n\nThe expected URL can be one of:\n\n- The full URL as a string\n- A regular expression\n- A function, called with the URL and returns true if the assertion is true\n- An [object](http://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_parse_urlstr_parsequerystring_slashesdenotehost), in which case individual properties are matched against the URL\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nbrowser.assert.url('http://localhost/foo/bar');\nbrowser.assert.url(new RegExp('^http://localhost/foo/\\\\w+$'));\nbrowser.assert.url({ pathname: '/foo/bar' });\nbrowser.assert.url({ query: { name: 'joedoe' } });\n```\n\n\n### Roll Your Own Assertions\n\nNot seeing an assertion you want?  You can add your own assertions to the\nprototype of `Browser.Assert`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\n// Asserts the browser has the expected number of open tabs.\nBrowser.Assert.prototype.openTabs = function(expected, message) {\n  assert.equal(this.browser.tabs.length, expected, message);\n};\n```\n\nOr application specific:\n\n```js\n// Asserts which links is highlighted in the navigation bar\nBrowser.Assert.navigationOn = function(linkText) {\n  this.assert.element('.navigation-bar');\n  this.assert.text('.navigation-bar a.highlighted', linkText);\n};\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Cookies\n\nAre delicious.  Also, somewhat tricky to work with.   A browser will only send a\ncookie to the server if it matches the request domain and path.\n\nMost modern Web applications don't care so much about the path and set all\ncookies to the root path of the application (`/`), but do pay attention to the\ndomain.\n\nConsider this code:\n\n```js\nbrowser.setCookie({ name: 'session', domain: 'example.com', value: 'delicious' });\nbrowser.visit('http://example.com', function() {\n  const value = browser.getCookie('session');\n  console.log('Cookie', value);\n});\n```\n\nIn order for the cookie to be set in this example, we need to specify the cookie\nname, domain and path.  In this example we omit the path and choose the default\n`/`.\n\nTo get the cookie in this example, we only need the cookie name, because at that\npoint the browser has an open document, and it can use the domain of that\ndocument to find the right cookie.  We do need to specify a domain if we're\ninterested in other cookies, e.g for a 3rd party widget.\n\nThere may be multiple cookies that match the same host, for example, cookies set\nfor `.example.com` and `www.example.com` will both match `www.example.com`, but\nonly the former will match `example.com`.  Likewise, cookies set for `/` and\n`/foo` will both match a request for `/foo/bar`.\n\n`getCookie`, `setCookie` and `deleteCookie` always operate on a single cookie,\nand they match the most specific one, starting with the cookies that have the\nlongest matching domain, followed by the cookie that has the longest matching\npath.\n\nIf the first argument is a string, they look for a cookie with that name using\nthe hostname of the currently open page as the domain and `/` as the path.  To\nbe more specific, the first argument can be an object with the properties\n`name`, `domain` and `path`.\n\nThe following are equivalent:\n\n```js\nbrowser.getCookie('session');\nbrowser.getCookie({ name: 'session',\n                    domain: browser.location.hostname,\n                    path: browser.location.pathname });\n```\n\n\n`getCookie` take a second argument.  If false (or missing), it returns the\nvalue of the cookie.  If true, it returns an object with all the cookie\nproperties: `name`, `value`, `domain`, `path`, `expires`, `httpOnly` and\n`secure`.\n\n#### browser.cookies\n\nReturns an object holding all cookies used by this browser.\n\n#### browser.cookies.dump(output?)\n\nDumps all cookies to standard output, or the output stream.\n\n#### browser.deleteCookie(identifier)\n\nDeletes a cookie matching the identifier.\n\nThe identifier is either the name of a cookie, or an object with the property\n`name` and the optional properties `domain` and `path`.\n\n#### browser.deleteCookies()\n\nDeletes all cookies.\n\n#### browser.getCookie(identifier, allProperties?)\n\nReturns a cookie matching the identifier.\n\nThe identifier is either the name of a cookie, or an object with the property\n`name` and the optional properties `domain` and `path`.\n\nIf `allProperties` is true, returns an object with all the cookie properties,\notherwise returns the cookie value.\n\n#### browser.setCookie(name, value)\n\nSets the value of a cookie based on its name.\n\n#### browser.setCookie(cookie)\n\nSets the value of a cookie based on the following properties:\n\n* `domain` - Domain of the cookie (requires, defaults to hostname of currently\n  open page)\n* `expires` - When cookie it set to expire (`Date`, optional, defaults to\n  session)\n* `maxAge` - How long before cookie expires (in seconds, defaults to session)\n* `name` - Cookie name (required)\n* `path` - Path for the cookie (defaults to `/`)\n* `httpOnly` - True if HTTP-only (not accessible from client-side JavaScript,\n  defaults to false)\n* `secure` - True if secure (requires HTTPS, defaults to false)\n* `value` - Cookie value (required)\n\n\n\n\n## Tabs\n\nJust like your favorite Web browser, Zombie manages multiple open windows as\ntabs.  New browsers start without any open tabs.  As you visit the first page,\nZombie will open a tab for it.\n\nAll operations against the `browser` object operate on the currently active tab\n(window) and most of the time you only need to interact with that one tab.  You\ncan access it directly via `browser.window`.\n\nWeb pages can open additional tabs using the `window.open` method, or whenever a\nlink or form specifies a target (e.g. `target=_blank` or `target=window-name`).\nYou can also open additional tabs by calling `browser.open`.  To close the\ncurrently active tab, close the window itself.\n\nYou can access all open tabs from `browser.tabs`.  This property is an\nassociative array, you can access each tab by its index number, and iterate over\nall open tabs using functions like `forEach` and `map`.\n\nIf a window was opened with a name, you can also access it by its name.  Since\nnames may conflict with reserved properties/methods, you may need to use\n`browser.tabs.find`.\n\nThe value of a tab is the currently active window.  That window changes when you\nnavigate forwards and backwards in history.  For example, if you visited the URL\n'/foo' and then the URL '/bar', the first tab (`browser.tabs[0]`) would be a\nwindow with the document from '/bar'.  If you then navigate back in history, the\nfirst tab would be the window with the document '/foo'.\n\nThe following operations are used for managing tabs:\n\n#### browser.tabs\n\nReturns an array of all open tabs.\n\n#### browser.tabs[number]\n\nReturns the tab with that index number.\n\n#### browser.tabs[string]\n#### browser.tabs.find(string)\n\nReturns the tab with that name.\n\n#### browser.tabs.closeAll()\n\nCloses all tabs.\n\n#### browser.tabs.current\n\nThis is a read/write property.  It returns the currently active tab.\n\nCan also be used to change the currently active tab.  You can set it to a\nwindow (e.g. as currently returned from `browser.current`), a window name or the\ntab index number.\n\n#### browser.tabs.dump(output?)\n\nDump a list of all open tabs to standard output, or the output stream.\n\n#### browser.tabs.index\n\nReturns the index of the currently active tab.\n\n#### browser.tabs.length\n\nReturns the number of currently opened tabs.\n\n#### browser.open (url)\n\nOpens and returns a new tab.  Supported options are:\n- `name` - Window name.\n- `url` - Load document from this URL.\n\n#### browser.window\n\nReturns the currently active window, same as `browser.tabs.current.`\n\n\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo see what your code is doing, you can use `console.log` and friends from both\nclient-side scripts and your test code.\n\nTo see everything Zombie does (opening windows, loading URLs, firing events,\netc), set the environment variable `DEBUG=zombie`.  Zombie uses the\n[debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module.  For example:\n\n```bash\n$ DEBUG=zombie mocha\n```\n\nYou can also turn debugging on from your code (e.g. a specific test you're\ntrying to troubleshoot) by calling `browser.debug()`.\n\nSome objects, like the browser, history, resources, tabs and windows also\ninclude `dump` method that will dump the current state to the console, or an\noutput stream of your choice.  For example:\n\n```js\nbrowser.dump();\nbrowser.dump(process.stderr);\n```\n\nIf you want to disable console output from scripts, set `browser.silent = true`\nor once for all browser instances with `Browser.silent = true`.\n\n\n\n\n## Events\n\nEach browser instance is an `EventEmitter`, and will emit a variety of events\nyou can listen to.\n\nSome things you can do with events:\n\n- Trace what the browser is doing, e.g. log every page loaded, every DOM event\n  emitted, every timeout fired\n- Wait for something to happen, e.g. form submitted, link clicked, input element\n  getting the focus\n- Strip out code from HTML pages, e.g remove analytics code when running tests\n- Add event listeners to the page before any JavaScript executes\n- Mess with the browser, e.g. modify loaded resources, capture and change DOM\n  events\n\n#### console (level, message)\n\nEmitted whenever a message is printed to the console (`console.log`,\n`console.error`, `console.trace`, etc).\n\nThe first argument is the logging level, and the second argument is the message.\n\nThe logging levels are: `debug`, `error`, `info`, `log`, `trace` and `warn`.\n\n#### active (window)\n\nEmitted when this window becomes the active window.\n\n#### closed (window)\n\nEmitted when this window is closed.\n\n#### done ()\n\nEmitted when the event loop goes empty.\n\n#### error (error)\n\nError when loading a resource, or evaluating JavaScript.\n\n#### evaluated (code, result, filename)\n\nEmitted after JavaScript code is evaluated.\n\nThe first argument is the JavaScript function or code (string).  The second\nargument is the result.  The third argument is the filename.\n\n#### event (event, target)\n\nEmitted whenever a DOM event is fired on the target element, document or window.\n\n#### focus (element)\n\nEmitted whenever an element receives the focus.\n\n#### idle ()\n\nEvent loop is idle.\n\n#### inactive (window)\n\nEmitted when this window is no longer the active window.\n\n#### interval (function, interval)\n\nEmitted whenever an interval (`setInterval`) is fired.\n\nThe first argument is the function or code to evaluate, the second argument is\nthe interval in milliseconds.\n\n#### link (url, target)\n\nEmitted when a link is clicked.\n\nThe first argument is the URL of the new location, the second argument\nidentifies the target window (`_self`, `_blank`, window name, etc).\n\n#### loaded (document)\n\nEmitted when a document has been loaded into a window or frame.\n\nThis event is emitted after the HTML is parsed, and some scripts executed.\n\n#### loading (document)\n\nEmitted when a document is about to be loaded into a window or frame.\n\nThis event is emitted when the document is still empty, before parsing any HTML.\n\n#### opened (window)\n\nEmitted when a new window is opened.\n\n#### redirect (request, response)\n\nEmitted when following a redirect.\n\n#### request (request)\n\nEmitted before making a request to retrieve a resource.\n\nThe first argument is the request object.  See [Resources](#resources) for more\ndetails.\n\n#### response (request, response)\n\nEmitted after receiving the response (excluding redirects).\n\nThe first argument is the request object, the second argument is the response\nobject.  See [Resources](#resources) for more details.\n\n#### serverEvent ()\n\nBrowser received server initiated event (e.g. `EventSource` message).\n\n#### setInterval (function, interval)\n\nEvent loop fired a `setInterval` event.\n\n#### setTimeout (function, delay)\n\nEvent loop fired a `setTimeout` event.\n\n#### submit (url, target)\n\nEmitted whenever a form is submitted.\n\nThe first argument is the URL of the new location, the second argument\nidentifies the target window (`_self`, `_blank`, window name, etc).\n\n#### timeout (function, delay)\n\nEmitted whenever a timeout (`setTimeout`) is fired.\n\nThe first argument is the function or code to evaluate, the second argument is\nthe delay in milliseconds.\n\n#### xhr (event, url)\n\nCalled for each XHR event (`progress`, `abort`, `readystatechange`, `loadend`,\netc).\n\n\n\n\n## Authentication\n\nZombie supports HTTP basic access authentication. To provide the login credentials:\n\n```js\nbrowser.on('authenticate', function(authentication) {\n  authentication.username = 'myusername';\n  authentication.password = 'mypassword';\n});\n\nbrowser.visit('/mypage');\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Resources\n\nZombie can retrieve with resources - HTML pages, scripts, XHR requests - over\nHTTP, HTTPS and from the file system.\n\nMost work involving resources is done behind the scenes, but there are few\nnotable features that you'll want to know about. Specifically, if you need to do\nany of the following:\n\n- Inspect the history of retrieved resources, useful for troubleshooting issues\n  related to resource loading\n- Request resources directly, but have Zombie handle cookies, authentication,\n  etc\n- Implement new mechanism for retrieving resources, for example, add new\n  protocols or support new headers (see [Pipeline](#pipeline))\n\n\n### The Resources List\n\nEach browser provides access to the list of resources loaded by the currently\nopen window via `browser.resources`.  You can iterate over this list just like\nany JavaScript array.\n\nEach resource provides three properties:\n\n- `request`   - The request object\n- `response`  - The resource object (if received)\n- `error`     - The error generated (no response)\n\nThe request object is based on the [Fetch API Request\nobject](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-class).\n\nThe response object is based on the [Fetch API Response\nobject](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#response-class).  Note that the fetch API\nhas the property `status`, whereas Node HTTP module uses `statusCode`.\n\n#### browser.fetch(input, init)\n\nYou can use the browser directly to make requests against external resources.\nThese requests will share the same cookies, authentication and other browser\nsettings (also pipeline).\n\nThe `fetch` method is based on the [Fetch\nAPI](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nbrowser.fetch(url)\n  .then(function(response) {\n    console.log('Status code:', response.status);\n    if (response.status === 200)\n      return response.text();\n  })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log('Document:', text);\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) {\n    console.log('Network error');\n  });\n```\n\nTo access the response document body as a Node buffer, use the following:\n\n```js\nresponse.arrayBuffer()\n  .then(Buffer) // arrayBuffer -> Buffer\n  .then(function(buffer) {\n    assert( Buffer.isBuffer(buffer) );\n  });\n```\n\n#### resources.dump(output?)\n\nDumps the resources list to the output stream (defaults to standard output\nstream).\n\n\n\n\n## Pipeline\n\nZombie uses a pipeline to operate on resources.  You can extend that pipeline\nwith your own set of handlers, for example, to support additional protocols,\ncontent types, special handlers, etc.\n\nThe pipeline consists of a set of handlers.  There are two types of handlers:\n\nFunctions with two arguments deal with requests.  They are called with the\nbrowser and request object.  They may modify the request object, and they may\neither return null (pass control to the next handler) or return the Response\nobject, or return a promise that resolves to either outcome.\n\nFunctions with three arguments deal with responses.  They are called with the\nbrowser, request and response objects.  They may modify the response object, and\nmust return a Response object, either the same as the argument or a new Response\nobject, either directly or through a promise.\n\nTo add a new handle to the end of the pipeline:\n\n```js\nbrowser.pipeline.addHandler(function(browser, request) {\n  // Let's delay this request by 1/10th second\n  return new Promise(function(resolve) {\n    setTimeout(resolve, 100);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nYou can add handlers to all browsers via `Pipeline.addHandler`.  These\nhandlers are automatically added to every new `browser.pipeline` instance.\n\n```js\nPipeline.addHandler(function(browser, request, response) {\n  // Log the response body\n  console.log('Response body: ' + response.body);\n});\n```\n\n"

  "language": "C",
  "readme_contents": "# ZombieLoad PoC\n\nThis repository contains several applications, demonstrating ZombieLoad. For technical information about the bug, refer to the paper:\n\n* [ZombieLoad: Cross-Privilege-Boundary Data Sampling](https://zombieload.com/zombieload.pdf) by Schwarz, Lipp, Moghimi, Van Bulck, Stecklina, Prescher, and Gruss\n\n## Proof of Concepts\n\nThis repository contains four different proof-of-concept attacks showing ZombieLoad. It also includes four different victim applications to test the leakage in various scenarios. \n\nAll demos are tested with an Intel Core i7-8650U, but they should work on any Linux system with any modern Intel Core or Xeon CPU since 2010. \nWe provide three variants for Linux, which we tested on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, and two variants for Windows, which we tested on Windows 10 (1803 build 17134.706). \n\nFor best results, we recommend a fast CPU that supports Intel TSX (e.g. nearly any Intel Core i7-5xxx, i7-6xxx, or i7-7xxx). \n\n## Building\n\nThe PoCs only require GCC and Make (on Linux) or MinGW-w64 (on Windows) to compile. \n\nBuilding an attacker or a victim is as simple as running `make` in the folder of the application. \n\n\n## Attacker Variants\n\nThe repository contains four different attacker variants.\n\n### Variant 1 (Linux only)\n\nVariant 1 is the fastest, easiest and most stable variant for a privileged attacker (i.e., it requires root privileges). Hence, except for testing, this is especially useful for attacks on SGX or for attacks on virtual machines. \n\n##### Run\n\nFor this variant, KASLR and KPTI have to be disabled. This can be achieved by providing `nopti nokaslr` to the kernel command line. \nThen, run the attacker on one hyperthread as root: `sudo taskset -c 3 ./leak`\n\n### Variant 2 (Linux and Windows)\n\nVariant 2 is a fast variant which does not require any privileges. However, it only works on CPUs supporting Intel TSX. Variant 2 is the only variant which also works on CPUs which already have hardware mitigations for Meltdown and Foreshadow. \n\n##### Run\nSimply run the attacker on one hyperthread: `taskset -c 3 ./leak`\n\n### Variant 3 (Windows only)\n\nVariant 3 does not require any CPU features or privileges but it only works on Windows. \n\n##### Run\nRun the attacker on one hyperthread: `start /affinity 3 .\\leak.exe`. It takes a while (up to 1 minute) until the leakage starts, as the PoC has to wait for Windows to collect information about the memory used by the PoC. Starting a different program which uses memory (e.g., a browser) sometimes reduces the waiting time. \n\n### Variant 4 (Linux only)\n\nVariant 4 is an interesting special subtype of Variant 2 which only works on CPUs supporting both Intel TSX and SGX. This variant abuses abort page semantics when accessing processor reserved memory in non-enclave mode, and hence requires either permissions to create an enclave or root privileges.\n\n##### Run\nThe demonstrator for this variant requires read access to Linux's `/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr` and `/dev/mem` virtual devices. This can be achieved by loading the `msr` driver, plus a small custom driver to lift Linux's default CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM restrictions:\n```bash\n$ sudo modprobe msr\n$ cd module && make load\n```\nThen, run the attacker on one hyperthread as root: `sudo taskset -c 3 ./leak`\n\n## Victim Applications\n\nAll attacker variants can be used to leak data from the following victim applications. All victim applications leak one uppercase letter. Independent of the chosen victim and attacker application, the attacker displays a histogram of leaked values. \n\nAn example output is as follows (for the secret letter 'X' loaded by the victim).\n\n    A: (   0) \n    B: (   0) \n    C: (   0) \n    D: (   0) \n    E: (   1) \n    F: (   0) \n    G: (   2) \n    H: (   0) \n    I: (   0) \n    J: (   0) \n    K: (   0) \n    L: (   0) \n    M: (   0) \n    N: (   0) \n    O: (   0) \n    P: (  12) \n    Q: (   1) \n    R: (   1) \n    S: (   0) \n    T: (   0) \n    U: (   2) \n    V: (   1) \n    W: (   0) \n    X: (1303) ############################################################\n    Y: (   0) \n    Z: (   1) \n\n### Userspace Victim (Linux and Windows)\n\nAn unprivileged user application which constantly loads the same value from its memory. \n\n##### Run (Linux)\n\nSimply run the victim on the same physical core but a different hyperthread as the attacker: `taskset -c 7 ./secret`. You can also provide a secret letter to the victim application as a parameter, e.g., `taskset -c 7 ./secret B` to access memory containing 'B's. The default secret letter is 'X'. \n\nAs soon as the victim is started, there should be a clear signal in the attacker process, i.e., the bar for the leaked letter should get longer. \n\n##### Run (Windows)\n\nSimply run the victim on the same physical core but a different hyperthread as the attacker: `start /affinity 7 .\\secret.exe`. You can also provide a secret letter to the victim application as a parameter, e.g., `start /affinity 7 .\\secret.exe B` to access memory containing 'B's. The default secret letter is 'X'. \n\nAs soon as the victim is started, there should be a clear signal in the attacker process, i.e., the bar for the leaked letter should get longer. \n\n### Kernel Victim (Linux only)\n\nA kernel module which constantly loads the letter 'J'.\n\n##### Run\n\nBefore running the victim, the kernel module has to be loaded into the kernel. This is done by running `sudo insmod leaky.ko`. Then, simply run the victim on the same physical core but a different hyperthread as the attacker: `taskset -c 7 ./secret`.\n\nAs soon as the victim is started, there should be a clear signal in the attacker process, i.e., the bar for the letter 'J' should get longer. \n\n### Intel SGX Victim (Linux only)\n\nAn Intel SGX enclave which constantly loads the letter 'S'. This victim requires that the SGX driver and SDK are installed. \n\n##### Run\n\nSimply run the victim on the same physical core but a different hyperthread as the attacker: `taskset -c 7 ./secret`.\n\nAs soon as the victim is started, there should be a clear signal in the attacker process, i.e., the bar for the letter 'S' should get longer. \n\n### VM Victim (Linux and Windows)\n\nA virtual machine containing an application which constantly loads the same value from its memory. This victim requires that QEMU is installed, and VT-x is enabled. \n\n##### Run\n\nSimply run the victim on the same physical core but a different hyperthread as the attacker: `taskset -c 7 ./secret.sh`. \nAs soon as the virtual machine started, the victim is run using  `secret X`\nWhere `X` is the secret character. There should be a clear signal in the attacker process, i.e., the bar for the leaked letter should get longer. \n\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* **How do I know which core IDs are hyperthreads?**\n\n    On Linux, you can run `lscpu -e`. This gives you a list of logical cores and their corresponding physical core. Cores mapping to the same physical core are hyperthreads. \n    On Windows, you can use the [coreinfo tool from Windows Sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/coreinfo). \n\n* **Can I run the PoC in a virtual machine?**\n\n    Yes, the PoC also works on virtual machines. However, due to the additional layer introduced by a virtual machine, it might not work as good as on native hardware. \n\n* **It just does not work on my computer, what can I do?**\n\n    There can be a lot of different reasons for that. We collected a few things you can try:\n    \n    * Ensure that your CPU frequency is at the maximum, and frequency scaling is disabled.\n    * If you run it on a mobile device (e.g., a laptop), ensure that it is plugged in to get the best performance.\n    * Try to pin the tools to a specific CPU core (e.g. with taskset). Also try different cores and core combinations. Leaking values only works if attacker and victim run on the same physical core. \n    * Vary the load on your computer. On some machines it works better if the load is higher, on others it works better if the load is lower.\n    * Use a different variant of ZombieLoad. In this repository, we provide 3 different techniques for the attacker. \n    * Try to restart the demos and also your computer. Especially after a standby, the timings are broken on some computers. \n\n## Warnings\n**Warning #1**: We are providing this code as-is. You are responsible for protecting yourself, your property and data, and others from any risks caused by this code. This code may cause unexpected and undesirable behavior to occur on your machine. This code may not detect the vulnerability on your machine.\n\n**Warning #2**: If you find that a computer is susceptible to ZombieLoad, you may want to avoid using it as a multi-user system. ZombieLoad breaches the CPU's memory protection. On a machine that is susceptible to ZombieLoad, one process can potentially read all data used by other processes or by the kernel.\n\n**Warning #3**: This code is only for testing purposes. Do not run it on any productive systems. Do not run it on any system that might be used by another person or entity.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# This workshop is no longer actively being maintained and is not recommended for use. Please visit our [Wild Rydes Serverless Workshops](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-workshops) for the latest hands-on examples of building serverless applications. This workshop is preserved here for interested community members to fork and update as separate project.\n\n# Zombie Microservices Workshop: Lab Guide\n\n## Overview of Workshop Labs\nThe [Zombie Microservices Workshop](http://aws.amazon.com/events/zombie-microservices-roadshow/) introduces the basics of building serverless applications using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), and other AWS services. In this workshop, as a new member of the AWS Lambda Signal Corps, you are tasked with completing the development of a serverless survivor communications system during the Zombie Apocalypse.\n\nThis workshop has a baseline survivor chat app that is launched via [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). Complete the lab exercises to extend the functionality of the communications system or add your own custom functionality!\n\nPrior to beginning the labs, you will need to finalize the setup of User authentication for the application with [Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html). This is a necessary step to finalize the readiness of the application.\n\n### Required: Setup Authentication with Cognito User Pools\nIn this setup lab, you will integrate user authentication into your serverless survivor chat application using Amazon Cognito User Pools.\n\n### Labs\nEach of the labs in this workshop is an independent section and you may choose to do some or all of them, or in any order that you prefer.\n\n* **Lab 1: Typing Indicator**  \n\n  This exercise already has the UI and backend implemented, and focuses on how to setup the API Gateway to provide a RESTful endpoint. You will configure the survivor chat application to display which survivors are currently typing in the chat room.\n\n* **Lab 2: SMS Integration with Twilio**  \n\n    This exercise uses [Twilio](http://twilio.com) to integrate SMS text functionality with the survivor chat application. You will configure a free-trial Twilio phone number so that users can send text messages to the survivor chat application. You'll learn to leverage mapping templates in API Gateway to perform data transformations in an API.\n\n* **Lab 3: Search Integration with Elasticsearch**  \n\n    This exercise adds an Elasticsearch cluster to the application which is used to index chat messages streamed from the DynamoDB table containing chat messages.\n\n* **Lab 4: Slack Integration**  \n\n    This exercise integrates the popular messaging app, [Slack](http://slack.com), into the chat application so that survivors can send messages to the survivor chat from within the Slack app.\n\n* **Lab 5: Intel Edison Zombie Motion Sensor** (IoT device required)\n\n    This exercise integrates motion sensor detection of zombies to the chat system using an Intel Edison board and a Grove PIR Motion Sensor. You will configure a Lambda function to consume motion detection events and push them into the survivor chat!\n\n### Workshop Cleanup\n\nThis section provides instructions to tear down your environment when you're done working on the labs.\n\n* * *\n\n### Let's Begin! Launch the CloudFormation Stack\n*Prior to launching a stack, be aware that a few of the resources launched need to be manually deleted when the workshop is over. When finished working, please review the \"Workshop Cleanup\" section to learn what manual teardown is required by you.*\n\n1\\. To begin this workshop, **click one of the 'Deploy to AWS' buttons below for the region you'd like to use**. This is the AWS region where you will launch resources for the duration of this workshop. This will open the CloudFormation template in the AWS Management Console for the region you select.\n\nRegion | Launch Template\n------------ | -------------\n**N.

Once you have chosen a region and are inside the AWS CloudFormation Console, you should be on a screen titled \"Select Template\". We are providing CloudFormation with a template on your behalf, so click the blue **Next** button to proceed.\n\n3\\. On the following screen, \"Specify Details\", your Stack is pre-populated with the name \"zombiestack\". You can customize that to a name of your choice **less than 15 characters in length** or leave as is. For the parameters section, if you want to develop with a team and would like to create IAM Users in your account to grant your teammates access, then specify how many teammates/users you want to be created in the **NumberOfTeammates** text box. Otherwise, leave it defaulted to 0 and no additional users will be created. The user launching the stack (you) already have the necessary permissions. Click **Next**.\n\n*If you create IAM users, an IAM group will also be created and those users will be added to that group. On deletion of the stack, those resources will be deleted for you.*\n\n4\\. On the \"Options\" page, leave the defaults and click **Next**.\n\n5\\. On the \"Review\" page, verify your selections, then scroll to the bottom and select the checkbox **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**. Then click **Create** to launch your stack.\n\n6\\. Your stack will take about 3 minutes to launch and you can track its progress in the \"Events\" tab. When it is done creating, the status will change to \"CREATE_COMPLETE\".\n\n7\\. Click the \"Outputs\" tab in CloudFormation and click the link for \"MyChatRoomURL\". This should open your chat application in a new tab. Leave this tab open as you'll come back to it later.\n\nPlease continue to the next section for the required Cognito User Pools authentication setup.\n\n## Setup Authentication with Cognito User Pools (Required)\n\nThe survivor chat uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication. Cognito Federated Identity enables you to authenticate users through an external identity provider and provides temporary security credentials to access your app\u2019s backend resources in AWS or any service behind Amazon API Gateway. Amazon Cognito works with external identity providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect, social identity providers (such as Facebook, Twitter, Amazon) and you can also integrate your own identity provider.\n\nIn addition to federating 3rd party providers such as Facebook, Google, and other providers, Cognito also offers a new built-in Identity Provider called [Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html).\n\nA Cognito Federated Identity pool has already been created for you when you launched CloudFormation.\n\nYou will now setup the Cognito User Pool as the user directory of your chat app survivors and configure it as a valid Authentication Provider with the Cognito Federated Identity Pool. API Gateway has been configured with IAM Authorization to only allow requests that are signed with valid AWS permissions. When a user signs into the Survivor Chat App (User Pool) successfully, a web call is made to the Cognito Federated Identity Pool to assume temporary AWS credentials for your authenticated user. These credentials are used to make signed [AWS SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) HTTPS requests to your message API.\n\n![Overview of Cognito Authentication](/Images/CognitoOverview.png)\n\n**Let's get started...**\n\n1\\. Navigate to the Cognito service console.\n\n![Navigate to the Cognito service](/Images/Cognito-Step1.png)\n\nCognito User Pools is not available in all AWS regions. Please review the list [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cognito_identity_region) for the regions that Cognito is available in. Therefore if you launched your CloudFormation stack in any region other than one of those listed on the above website, then please use the top navigation bar in the management console to switch AWS regions and navigate to **us-east-1 (Virginia)** to configure Cognito. Your application will stay hosted in the region you launched the CloudFormation template, but the authentication with Cognito will reside in us-east-1 (Virginia). If you launched the Cloudformation stack in one of those regions where Cognito exists, then please simply navigate to the Cognito service in the AWS Management Console as the service is available in that region already and you will configure it within that region.\n\nWhen inside the Cognito service console, click the blue button **Manage your User Pools**. You will setup the user directory that your chat application users will authenticate to when they use your app.\n\n2\\. Click the blue button **Create a User Pool** in the upper right corner. You'll create a new user directory.\n\n3\\. In the \"Pool Name\" text box, name your user pool **[Your CloudFormation stack name]-userpool**. For example, if you named your CloudFormation stack \"sample\" earlier, then your user pool name would be \"sample-userpool\". After naming your User Pool, click **Step through Settings** to continue with manual setup.\n\n4\\. On the attributes page, select the \"Required\" checkbox for the following attributes: **email, name, phone number**.\n\n* Cognito User Pools allows you to define attributes that you'd like to associate with users of your application. These represent values that your users will provide when they sign up for your app. They are available to your application as a part of the session data provided to your client apps when users authenticate with Cognito.\n\n5\\. Click the link \"Add custom attribute\". Leave all the defaults and type a \"Name\" of **slackuser** exactly as typed here. Add 2 additional custom attributes: **slackteamdomain** and **camp**.\n\n* Within a User Pool, you can specify custom attributes which you define when you create the User Pool. For the Zombie Survivor chat application, we will include 3 custom attributes.\n\nYour attributes configuration should match the image below:\n\n![Cognito User Pools: Attributes Configuration](/Images/Cognito-Step5.png)\n\nClick **Next Step**.\n\n6\\. On the Policies page, leave the Password policy settings as default and click **Next step**.\n\n7\\. On the verifications page, leave the defaults and click **Next step**.\n\n* We will not require MFA for this application. However, for during sign up we are requiring verification via email address. This is denoted with the email checkbox selected for \"Do you want to require verification of emails or phone numbers?\". With this setting, when users sign up for the application, a confirmation code will be sent to their email which they'll be required to input into the application for confirmation.\n\n8\\. On the \"Message Customizations\" page, in the section titled **Do you want to customize your email verification message?** add a custom email subject such as \"Signal Corps Survivor Confirmation\". We won't modify the message body but you could add your own custom message in there. We'll let Cognito send the emails from the service email address, but in production you could configure Cognito to send these verifications from an email server you own. Leave the rest of the default settings and click **Next step**.\n\nOn the Tags page, leave the defaults and click **Next step**. Next, on the Devices page, leave the default option of \"No\" selected. We will not configure the User Pool to remember user's devices.\n\n9\\. On the Apps page, click **Add an app**. In the **App Name** textbox, type \"Zombie Survivor Chat App\" and **deselect the client secret checkbox**. Click **Set attribute read and write permissions**. You need to make sure that the app has \"writable\" and \"readable\" access to the attributes you created. Make sure that **all of the checkboxes are selected** for \"Readable Attributes\" and \"Writable Attributes\". Then click **Create app**, and then click **Next step**.\n\n10\\. In the dropdowns for the **Pre authentication** and **Post confirmation** triggers, select the Lambda function named \"[Your CloudFormation Stack name]-CognitoLambdaTrigger-[Your Region]\". Click **Next step**.\n\n* Cognito User Pools allows developers to inject custom workflow logic into the signup and signin process. This custom workflow logic is represented with AWS Lambda functions known as Lambda Triggers.\n\n* With this feature, developers can pass information to a Lambda function and specify that function to invoke at different stages of the signup/signin process, allowing for a serverless and event driven authentication process.\n\n* In this application, we will create two (2) Lambda triggers:\n\n    * Post-Confirmation: This trigger will invoke after a user successfully submits their verification code upon signup and becomes a confirmed user. The Lambda function associated with this trigger takes the attributes provided by the user and inserts them into a custom Users table in DynamoDB that was created with CloudFormation. This allows us to perform querying of user attributes within our application.\n\n    * Pre-Authentication: This trigger will invoke when a user's information is submitted for authentication to Cognito each time the survivor signs into the web application. The code for with this Lambda Trigger takes the user's attributes have been passed in as parameters from the invoking User Pool and using them to perform an update on the User's record in DynamoDB Users table. This allows us to load the user's data into DynamoDB when they initially sign in and also keep it current with the values in User Pools in an on-going basis as they log in each time.\n\n    * For this workshop we use the same backend Lambda function for both of the triggers. On invocation, the function checks what type of even has occurred, Post-Confirmation or Pre-Authentication, and executes the correct code accordingly.\n\n11\\. Review the settings for your User Pool and click **Create pool**. If your pool created successfully you should be returned to the Pool Details page and it will display a green box that says \"Your user pool was created successfully\".\n\n12\\. Open a text editor on your computer and copy into it the \"Pool Id\" displayed on the Pool details page. Then click into the **Apps** tab found on the left side navigation pane. You should see an **App client id** displayed. Copy that **App client id** into your text editor as well.\n\nYou are done configuring the User Pool. You will now setup federation into the Cognito Identity Pool that has already been created for you.\n\n* An [Amazon Cognito Identity Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html) has been configured for you. Identity Pools allow external federated users to assume temporary credentials from AWS to make service API calls from within your apps.\n\n* You've just created the User Pool for authentication into your app. Now your users still need access to make IAM Authorized AWS API calls.\n\n* You'll setup federation inside of Cognito Identity and allow your User Pool as an **Authentication Provider**.\n\nOn the top navigation bar in the management console, switch to **Federated Identities** by clicking the link as shown below.\n\n![Navigating to Federated Identities Console](/Images/Cognito-Step12.png)\n\n13\\. Click into the Identity Pool that has already been created for you. It should be named \"[Your CloudFormation stack name] _ identitypool\". On the Idenity pool dashboard, in the upper right, select **Edit identity pool**.\n\n14\\. Cognito Identity allows you to give access to both authenticated users and unauthenticated (guest) users. The permissions associated with these groups of users is dictated by the IAM role that you attach to these Cognito roles. Your Authenticated and Unauthenticated Cognito roles have already been configured for you in CloudFormation. The Authenticated role has been configured to give permissions to the principal (your Cognito authenticated application user) to make \"execute-api:invoke\" calls to the API Gateway endpoint ARNs associated with the survivor serverless app.\n\n* When users authenticate into the application, they become an authenticated user, and the application allows them to send chat messages to the survivor chat.\n\n15\\. Click the black dropdown arrow in the section titled \"Authentication providers\". You will configure your Identity pool to allow federated access from your Identity Provider, your Cognito User Pool. In the \"Cognito\" identity provider tab, insert your **User Pool ID** and **App Client ID** into their respective text boxes from your text editor file. Do not delete them from the text file, you'll need these items again in a later step.\n\nYou should have copied these from your User Pool earlier when you set it up. If you do not have these copied, please navigate back to your Cognito User Pool you created earlier and locate your User Pool Id and App Client ID.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save Changes** to save the User Pool configuration settings. Your Cognito Federated Identiy Pool has been configured with Congito User Pool as an IdP. When users authenticate to the User Pool, they will assume temporary credentials with the permissions allowed via the Authenticated Role.\n\n16\\. You will now make an update to an application config file so that the serverless Javascript application can communicate with your User Pool to log users in.\n\nNavigate to the Amazon S3 console **in the region where you launched your CloudFormation stack.**\n\n* If you changed regions to configure Cognito, please return back to the region where you launched the stack and navigate to the S3 service.\n\n![Navigate to the S3 service](/Images/Cognito-Step16.png)\n\n17\\. On the Amazon S3 buckets listing page, find and click into the bucket that was created for you by CloudFormation. It should be named with your stack name prepended to the beginning. Something like [CloudFormation Stack Name]-s3bucketforwebsitecontent\"....\n\n* In the S3 Console search bar you can type **s3bucketforwebsitecontent** and your S3 bucket will display.\n\n18\\. This bucket contains all the contents for hosting your serverless JS app as well as the source code for the workshop's Lambda functions and CloudFormation resources. Please do not delete these contents. Click into the folder (prefix) named **S3** and navigate through to the file **S3/assets/js/constants.js**\n\nDownload the **S3/assets/js.constants.js** file to your local machine and open it with a text editor.\n\n![Download the constants.js file](/Images/Cognito-Step18.png)\n\n19\\. Open up the constants.js file and copy over the User Pool ID into the \"USER_POOL_ID\" variable. Then copy the App Client ID into the \"CLIENT_ID\" variable. These should be copied from the open text file you had open from earlier.\n\n* Your serverless javascript zombie application requires this constants values in file communicate with the different services of the workshop.\n\n* The Identity Pool Id was automatically filled in with several other variables when the CloudFormation template was launched.\n\n20\\. Save the constants.js file and upload it back to S3. While in the S3 console window, make sure you are in the **js** directory. Click the blue **Upload** button and upload the constants.js file from your local machine. Within the upload dialog, select the \"Manage public permissions\" dropdown and set the permissions on the file to read-only for the public by selecting the **Read** checkbox next to Everyone under the Objects category. You can also drag your file from your local machine into the S3 browser console to initiate an upload and then when the object is uploaded, make sure to select **Make Public**.\n\n* Your application now has the configuration it needs to interact with Cognito.\n\n21\\. Navigate back to CloudFormation and find the Chat Room URL (MyChatRoomURL) in the Outputs tab of your CloudFormation stack. Click it to open the chat application in a new browser window.\n\n* If you already had the application opened in your browser, please refresh the page so that the new constants.js loads with the app.\n\n22\\. You should see a sign in page for the Zombie survivor web app. You need to create an account so click **Sign Up**.\n\n23\\. Fill out the form to sign up as a survivor.\n\n* **Select your Camp**: Specify the geography where you live! Currently this attribute is not used in the application and is available for those that want to tackle an extra credit opportunity!. When you're done with the workshop, try and tackle the Channel Challenge in the Appendix.\n\n* **Slack Username**: Type the Slack Username you will use during the Slack lab of this workshop. This associates your Slack username with your Survivor app user account and is required if you want to do the Slack lab.\n\n* **Slack Team Domain Name**: Slack users can be members of many teams. Type the Slack team domain name that you want to integrate with this survivor chat app. The combination of a Slack team domain and Slack Username will unique identity a user to associate with your new Survivor chat app account.\n\nWhen done, click **Sign Up**.\n\n24\\. A form should appear asking you to type in your confirmation code. Please check your inbox for the email address you signed up with. You should received an email with the subject \"Signal Corps Survivor Confirmation\" (May be in your Spam folder!). Copy over the verification code and enter into the confirmation window.\n\n**Troubleshooting tips:**\n\n* If you are getting errors during the signup, please revisit the settings for your Cognito User Pool. You need to make sure that you've done the following -  \n\n    * Configured your Cognito Lambda triggers for both the **Pre-Authentication** and **Post-Confirmation** steps as described in Step 10.\n\n    * Properly modified the constants.js config file and re-uploaded it to the JS directory for your application in S3. After you uploaded this constants.js file, you should have refreshed your zombie chat browser application page so that it could pull down the latest JS files. The application is client-side and needs this file's properties in order to bootstrap itself.\n\n* Users created in the application are also stored in a DynamoDB table named \"Users\". If you did not have your Cognito triggers set up correctly, you will need to navigate to the DynamoDB Users table and delete the entry for your user. You can then re-register in the application again.\n\n\n![Confirm your signup](/Images/Cognito-Step24.png)\n\nAfter confirming your account, sign in with your credentials and begin chatting! You should see a red button called **Start Chatting** - click that button to toggle your session on. You may then begin typing messages followed by the \"Enter\" key to submit them.\n\n25\\. Your messages should begin showing up in the central chat pane window. Feel free to share the URL with your teammates, have them signup for accounts and begin chatting as a group! If you are building this solution solo, you can create multiple user accounts with different email addresses. Then login to both user accounts in different browsers to simulate multiple users.\n\n**The baseline chat application is now configured and working! There is still important functionality missing and the Lambda Signal Corps needs you to build it out...so get started below!**\n\n*This workshop does not utilize API Gateway Cache. Please KEEP THIS FEATURE TURNED OFF as it is not covered under the AWS Free Tier and will incur additional charges. It is not a requirement for the workshop.*\n\n## Lab 1 - Typing Indicator\n\n**What you'll do in this lab...**\n\nIn this section you will create functionality in your chat application that allows survivors to see which survivors in the chat room are currently typing. To configure this functionality, you will modify your API to integrate with backend Lambda functions that are responsible for querying and returning the users currently typing in the system, as well as updating metadata in the \"talkers\" DynamoDB table that contains details about which survivors are typing at which times. The survivor chat app continuously polls this API endpoint with GET requests to determine who is typing. As survivors are typing, POST requests are made to this same endpoint to update the talkers DynamoDB table.\n\nThe typing indicator shows up in the web chat client in a section below the chat message panel. The UI and backend Lambda functions have already been implemented, and this lab focuses on how to configure your new integration in API Gateway.\n\nThe application uses [CORS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html). This lab will both wire up the backend Lambda function as well as perform the necessary steps to enable CORS.\n\n**Typing Indicator Architecture**\n![Overview of Typing Indicator Architecture](/Images/TypingIndicatorOverview.png)\n\n1\\. Navigate to the API Gateway service. You can search for it on the main console homepage or type in the service name to quickly access the service (as shown below)\n![API Gateway in Management Console](/Images/Typing-Step1.png)\n\n2\\. On the APIs listing screen in API Gateway, click into your Zombie chat API. It should be prefixed with the name of your CloudFormation stack that launched it. By default this should be \"zombiestack-\". Select the Zombie Workshop API Gateway.\n\n3\\. Click the **GET** method of your /zombie/talkers resource located at **/zombie/talkers/GET**. You can do this by clicking the \"GET\" method under the /zombie/talkers resource. The GET method is highlighted in blue in the image below. Click there.\n![GET Method](/Images/Typing-Step3.png)\n\n*This GET HTTP method is used by the survivor chat app to perform continuous queries on the DynamoDB talkers table to determine which users are typing.*\n\n4\\. Click the **Integration Request** box.\n\n5\\. Under \"Integration Type\", Select **Lambda Function.**\n\n* Currently, this API method is configured to a \"MOCK\" integration. MOCK integrations are dummy backends that are useful when you are testing and don't yet have the backend built out but need the API to return sample dummy data. You will remove the MOCK integration and configure this GET method to connect to a Lambda function that queries DynamoDB.\n\n6\\. For the **Lambda Region** field, select the region in which you launched the CloudFormation stack. (HINT: Select the region code that corresponds with the yellow CloudFormation button you clicked to launch the CloudFormation template. You can also look in the upper right corner of the Management Console to see which region you are in). For example if you launched your stack in Virginia (us-east-1), then you will select us-east-1 as your Lambda Region.\n\n* When you launched the CloudFormation template, the launch also created several Lambda functions for you locally in the region where you launched your CFN stack - this includes functions for retrieving data from and putting data into a DynamoDB \"Talkers\" table with details about which survivors are currently typing in the chat room.\n\n7\\. For the Lambda Function field, begin typing \"gettalkers\" in the text box. In the auto-fill dropdown, select the function that contains \"GetTalkersFromDynamoDB\" in the name. It should look something like this.... **[CloudformationTemplateName]-[XXXXXXX]-GetTalkersFromDynamoDB-[Your Region]**.\n\n* This Lambda function is written in NodeJs. It performs GetItem DynamoDB requests on a Table called Talkers. This talkers table contains records that are continuously updated whenever users type in the chat room. By hooking up this Lambda function to your GET method, it will get invoked by API Gateway when the chat app polls the API with GET requests.\n\n8\\. Select the blue **Save** button and click **OK** if a pop up asks you to confirm that you want to switch to Lambda integration. Then grant access for API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function by clicking \"OK\" again. This 2nd popup asks you to confirm that you want to allow API Gateway to be able to invoke your Lambda function.\n\n9\\. Click the **Method Execution** back button to return to the method execution overview page. You'll now tell API Gateway what types of HTTP response types you want your API to expose. Click the **Method Response** section of the Method Execution Flow.\n\n10\\. Add a 200 HTTP Status response. Click \"Add Response\", type \"200\" in the status code text box and then click the little checkmark to save the method response, as shown below.\n![Method Response](/Images/Typing-Step10.png)\n\n* You've configured the GET method of the /zombie/talkers resource to allow responses with HTTP status of 200. We could add more response types but we'll skip that for simplicity in this workshop.\n\n11\\. Go to the /zombie/talkers/POST method by clicking the \"POST\" option in the resource tree on the left navigation pane.\n![POST Method](/Images/Typing-Step11.png)\n\n12\\. We're now going to configure to the /zombie/talkers resource to properly integrate with AWS Lambda on POST requests.\n\n**Perform Steps 4-10 again** just as you did for the GET method. However, this time when you are selecting the Lambda Function for the Integration Request, you'll type \"writetalkers\" in the auto-fill and select the function that looks something like this... **[CloudformationTemplateName]-[XXXXXXX]-WriteTalkersToDynamoDB-[Your Region]**. This way on POST requests, API Gateway will invoke your **writetalkers** Lambda function. Don't forget to return to the Method Response section for this POST method and add a \"200\" HTTP response status as you did for the GET method earlier, if it doesn't exist already.\n\n* In these steps you are configuring the POST method that is used by the chat app to insert data into DynamoDB Talkers table with details about which users are typing. You're performing the same exact method configuration for the POST method as you did for your GET method. However, since this POST method is used for sending data to the database, it triggers a different backend Lambda function. This function writes data to DynamoDB while the \"GetTalkersToDynamoDB\" function was used to retrieve data from DynamoDB.\n\n\t* You could optionally include the logic for both the POST and GET operations inside of a single Lambda function with your own built-in logic that properly checks for and handles POSTs and GETs (or other actions).\n\n13\\. Go to the /zombie/talkers/OPTIONS method\n\n14\\. Select the Method Response.\n\n15\\. Add a 200 method response. Click \"Add Response\", type \"200\" in the status code text box and then click the little checkmark to save the method response.\n\n16\\. Go back to the OPTIONS method flow and select the Integration Response. (To go back, there should be a blue hyperlink titled \"Method Execution\" which will bring you back to the method execution overview screen).\n\n17\\. Select the Integration Response.\n\n18\\. Add a new Integration response with a method response status of 200. Click the \"Method response status\" dropdown and select \"200\". Leave the \"Content Handling\" option set to **Passthrough**. When done, click the blue **Save** button.\n\n* In this section you configured the OPTIONS method simply to respond with HTTP 200 status code. The OPTIONS method type is simply used so that clients can retrieve details about the API resources that are available as well as the methods associated with them.\n\n19\\. Select the /zombie/talkers resource on the left navigation tree.\n![talker resource](/Images/Typing-Step19.png)\n\n20\\. Click the \"Actions\" box and select \"Enable CORS\" in the dropdown.\n\n21\\. Select Enable and Yes to replace the existing values. You should see all green checkmarks for the CORS options that were enabled, as shown below.\n![talker resource](/Images/Typing-Step21.png)\n\n* If you don't see all green checkmarks, this is probably because you forgot to add the HTTP Status 200 code for the Method Response Section. Go back to the method overview section for your POST, GET, and OPTIONS method and make sure that it shows \"HTTP Status: 200\" in the Method Response box.\n\n22\\. Click the \"Actions\" box and select Deploy API  \n![talker resource](/Images/Typing-Step22.png)\n\n23\\. Select the ZombieWorkshopStage deployment and hit the Deploy button.\n\n* In this workshop we deploy the API to a stage called \"ZombieWorkshopStage\". In your real world scenario, you'll likely create different stages of the API to reflect different versions that you'd like to maintain.\n\n**LAB 1 COMPLETE**\n\nHead back to the survivor chat app and **Refresh the page** type messages. POST requests are being made to the Talkers API resource which is updating a DynamoDB table continuously with timestamps along with who is typing. Simultaneously, the application is performing a continuous polling (GET Requests) against /zombie/talkers to show which survivors are typing. This displays\n\n![talker resource](/Images/Typing-Done.png)\n\n* * *\n\n## Lab 2 - SMS Integration with Twilio\n\n**What you'll do in this lab...**\n\nIn this section, you\u2019ll create a free-trial Twilio SMS phone number. You will configure this Twilio phone number with a webhook to forward all incoming text messages sent to your Twilio number to the /zombie/twilio API resource in API Gateway. This will allow you to communicate with survivors in the chat room via text message.\n\n**SMS Twilio Integration Architecture**\n![Overview of Twilio Integration](/Images/TwilioOverview.png)\n\n1\\. Sign up for a free trial Twilio account at https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio. Or if you have an existing Twilio account, login.\n\n2\\. Once you have created your account, login to the Twilio console and navigate to the Home icon on the left navigation pane. On the Home screen/console dashboard, scroll down to the **Phone Numbers** section and click \"Phone Numbers\".\n![Manage Twilio Phone Number](/Images/Twilio-Step2.png)\n\n3\\. On the Phone Numbers screen, click **Get Started** to assign a phone number to your account. Then click the red **Get your first Twilio phone number** button. We\u2019re going to generate a 10-digit phone number in this lab, but a short-code would also work if preferred. This number should be enabled for voice and messaging by default. A popup will appear with your new phone number, click **Choose this number**. If the proposed phone number does not support messaging, click \"Search for a different number\", select your country and select the checkbox \"SMS\", then click \"Search\". Twilio propose a list of phone number, select \"Choose number\" for one of them. Then, type your address, click \"Save and continue\" and \"Done\".\n\n* **International Users** - These are US phone numbers that you are provisioning in Twilio. You can also choose to configure an internationl number in Twilio, however there may be charges that apply. Currently this workshop only supports US phone numbers in the front end JS application due to the necessary formatting logic that has yet to be introduced into the code!\n\nIf you have an international mobile device, you can still do this lab. When registering for a user account in the zombie chat, just use a dummy placeholder 10 digit phone number for now. Later steps in this lab will illustrate a workaround that allows you to send SMS using your international phne number*\n\n4\\. Once you\u2019ve received a phone number, click the **Manage Numbers** button on the left navigation pane. Click on your phone number, which will take you to the properties page for that number.\n\n5\\. Scroll to the bottom of the properties page, to the **Messaging** section. In the **Configure With** dropdown, select the **Webhooks/TwiML** option. Leave this page open for now and proceed to the next step.\n\n* The Twilio webhooks section allows you to integrate your phone number with third party services. In this case, you're going to configure your Twilio phone number to forward any messages it receives over to your API Gateway /zombie/twilio resource with POST requests.\n\n6\\. Now you\u2019ll retrieve your **/zombie/twilio** API endpoint from API Gateway and provide it to Twilio to hook up to AWS. Open the AWS Management console in a new tab, and navigate to API Gateway, as illustrated below. Be sure to leave the Twilio tab open as you\u2019ll need it again to finish setup.\n![API Gateway in Management Console](/Images/Twilio-Step6.png)\n\n7\\. In the API Gateway console, select your API.  Then on the left navigation tree, under your API, click **Stages**.\n![API Gateway Resources Page](/Images/Twilio-Step7.png)\n\n8\\. With \"Stages\" selected, expand the \"ZombieWorkshopStage\" by clicking the blue arrow. Once expanded, select the **POST** method for the **/zombie/twilio** resource. The **/zombie/twilio** resource is the endpoint that we automatically created for you in CloudFormation for SMS integration with twilio.com. You should see an **Invoke URL** displayed for your **/zombie/twilio** resource, as shown below.\n![API Gateway Invoke URL](/Images/Twilio-Step8.png)\n\n9\\. Copy the **Invoke URL** and return to the Twilio website. On the Twilio page that you left open, paste the Invoke URL from API Gateway into the text box next to the label **A message comes in**. Ensure that the request type is set to **HTTP POST**. This is illustrated below.\n![Twilio Request URL](/Images/Twilio-Step9.png)\n\n10\\. Click **Save** to finalize the setup connecting Twilio to your API.\n\n11\\. You will now create the Lambda Function that processes your incoming Twilio messages, parses the message, and proxies it along to your /zombie/message Chat Service. To begin, navigate to the Lambda console.\n\n* As you'll see throughout this workshop, we will leverage separate Lambda functions to pre-process data before sending standardized/formatted requests to the /zombie/message resource. This allows us to-reuse the existing DynamoDB logic sitting behind the /zombie/message resource rather than writing multiple separate functions that all interact with DynamoDB individually. As messages come in to your Twilio number, the Twilio webhook forwards them with HTTP POST requests to your /zombie/twilio resource, which will be integrated with a backend pre-processing Lambda function. This pre-processing function will strip apart the Twilio payload and format it before making a signed SigV4 HTTPS POST to your /zombie/message service which requires IAM authorization in order to be invoked.\n\n12\\. Click **Create a Lambda function** and select the blueprint titled **Blank Function** as we will be creating a brand new function. Click **Next** to skip through the Configure Triggers screen.\n\n13\\. Create a name for the function, such as **\"[Your CloudFormation stack name]-TwilioProcessing\"**. Set the \"Runtime\" as **Node.js 4.3**. In the source code found on Github, open the **TwilioProcessing.js** file found inside the **/Twilio** folder. Delete the sample code in the Lambda console editor and replace it with the entire contents from your TwilioProcessing.js file. Once you have copied the code into Lambda, scroll down to [line 8](/Twilio/TwilioProcessing.js#L8) in the code where the **API** variable is declared. **API.endpoint** should show a value of \"INSERT YOUR API GATEWAY URL HERE INCLUDING THE HTTPS://\". Please replace this string with the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the URL for your **/zombie/message** POST method found in API Gateway. For example, it should look something like \"https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\".\n\nYou should also fill in the region code in the variable **API.region**. This should be the region where you launched CloudFormation.\n\nNext, you will also copy in the name of your DynamoDB **Users** table that was created for you. This should be named as **[Your CloudFormation Stack Name]-users\"**. You should copy this table name into the **table** variable in your Lambda code. You will also need to copy in the name of your \"phoneindex\" (this is an index that was created on the DynamoDB table to assist with querying). These attributes can be found in the Outputs section in CloudFormation. You should be copying the values for **DynamoDBUsersTableName** and **DynamoDBUsersPhoneIndex** from CloudFormation.\n\n* Some of the functions in this workshop were originally authored for Nodejs 0.10 but are still capable of running in the Node4.3 runtimes +. The workshop will soon be upgraded to use the latest Nodejs runtime that is supported by Lambda.\n\n14\\. After you have copied the code into the Lambda inline code console and modified the variables, scroll down to the **Lambda function handler and role** section. **Choose an existing role** should be selected from the dropdown. Then for the existing **role**, select the role that looks like **[Your stack name]-ZombieLabLambdaRole...**. For simplicity we are reusing the same Lambda role for our functions.\n\n15\\. Under \"Advancted settings\", set the **Timeout** field to 30 seconds and keep all the rest of the defaults set. Then click **Next** and then **Create function** on the Review page to create your Lambda function.\n\n* You have just created a Lambda function that is integrated as the backend for your /zombie/twilio resource POST method. The function converts the parameters to the correct format for our Chat Service including a conversion to JSON format, and makes an HTTPS POST request to the /zombie/message Chat Service resource. That endpoint will take care of inserting the data into the DynamoDB messages table.\n\n16\\. Now that you have created the TwilioProcessing function, you need to connect it to the **POST** method for your /zombie/twilio endpoint. Navigate back to the API Gateway console and select the **POST** method for your **/zombie/twilio** resource.\n\n17\\. On the **Method Execution** screen for the \"POST\" method, the \"Integration Request\" box should show a type of **MOCK** for your /twilio resource.\n\n18\\. You will now change the **Integration Request** so that instead of integrating with a Mock integration, it will integrate with your TwilioProcessing Lambda function. Click **Integration Request**. On the Integration Request screen, change the \"Integration type\" radio button to **Lambda Function**. In the \"Lambda Region\" dropdown, select the region in which you created your TwilioProcessing Lambda function, and where you launched your CloudFormation Stack. For the **Lambda Function**, begin typing \"TwilioProcessing\" and the autofill should display your function. Select your **TwilioProcessing** function from the autofill. Click **Save**. In the popup window, confirm that you want to switch to Lambda Integration by clicking **OK**. Then confirm that you want to give API Gateway permission to invoke your function by clicking **OK**. Wait a few seconds for the changes to save.\n\n19\\. You will be brought back to the Integration Request page for your \"POST\" method.\n\n20\\. Twilio sends data from their API with a content-type of \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", but Lambda requires the content-type to be \"application/json\" for any payload parameters sent to it. You will configure a Mapping Template so that API Gateway converts the content type of incoming messages into JSON before executing your backend Lambda TwilioProcessing function with the parameters.\n\n21\\. On the Integration Request screen for your /zombie/twilio POST method, expand the **Body Mapping Templates** section and click **Add mapping template**. In the textbox for \"Content-Type\", input **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** and click the little checkmark button to continue. Once you have clicked the little checkbox, a popup window will appear asking if you want to only allow requests that match the Content-Type you specified. Click **Yes, secure this integration**. A new section will appear below with a dropdown for **Generate Template**. Click that dropdown and select **Method Request Passthrough**.\n\n22\\. A \"Template\" text editor window will appear. In this section you will input a piece of VTL transformation logic to convert the incoming Twilio data to JSON format. In this text editor, **delete all of the pre-filled content** and copy the following code into the editor.\n\n```{\"postBody\" : \"$input.path('$')\"}```\n\nAfter copying the code into the editor, click the **Save** button. You have now setup the POST method to convert the incoming data to JSON anytime a POST request is made to your /zombie/twilio resource with a Content-Type of \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\". This should look like the screenshot below:\n![Twilio Integration Request Mapping Template](/Images/Twilio-Step22.png)\n\n23\\. Now that you have configured the Integration Request to transform incoming messages into JSON, we need to configure the Integration Response to transform outgoing responses back to Twilio into XML format since the Twilio API requires XML as a response Content-Type. This step is required so that when you send SMS messages to the survivor Chat Service, it can respond back to your Twilio Phone Number with a confirmation message that your message was received successfully.\n\n24\\. Head back to the Method Execution screen for the twilio POST method. On the \"Method Execution\" screen for your /zombie/twilio POST method, click **Integration Response**. On the \"Integration Response\" screen, click the black arrow to expand the method response section. Expand the **Body Mapping Templates** section. You should see a Content-Type of \"application/json\". We need a Content-Type of XML, not JSON, so **delete this Content-Type by clicking the little black minus icon** and click **Delete** on the pop-up window.\n\n25\\. Click **Add mapping template** similar to the way you did this in the earlier steps for the Integration Request section.\n\n26\\. In the \"Content-Type\" text box, insert **application/xml** and click the little black checkmark to continue. Similar to the steps done earlier, we are going to copy VTL mapping logic to convert the response data to XML from JSON. This will result in your /zombie/twilio POST method responding to requests with XML format. After you have created the new content-type, a new section will appear below with a dropdown for **Generate Template**. Click that dropdown and select **Method Request Passthrough**.\nIn the text editor, delete all the code already in there and copy the following into the editor:\n\n```\n#set($inputRoot = $input.path('$'))\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<Response>\n    <Message>\n        <Body>\n            $inputRoot\n        </Body>\n    </Message>\n</Response>\n```\n\nClick the grey \"Save\" button to continue.\n\nThe result should look like the screenshot below:\n\n![Twilio Integration Response Mapping Template](/Images/Twilio-Step26.png)\n\n27\\. Scroll up and click the blue **Save** button on the screen. Finally click the **Actions** button on the left side of the API Gateway console and choose **Deploy API** to deploy your API. In the Deploy API window, select **ZombieWorkshopStage** from the dropdown and click **Deploy**.\n\n28\\. You are now ready to test out Twilio integration with your API. Send a text message to your Twilio phone number from your mobile device.\n\n**LAB 2 COMPLETE**\n\nIf the integration was successful, you should receive a confirmation response text message and your text message you sent should display in the web app chat room as coming from your Twilio Phone Number. You have successfully integrated Twilio text message functionality with API Gateway.\n\n* **Troubleshooting tip**: If you are unable to send text messages, please ensure you are sending from the same phone number that you registered when you signed up for a survivor account in the Zombie Chat. If you review the TwilioProcessing Lambda function you will see that the code is checking the DynamoDB users table to confirm if the incoming message forward to us from Twilio was sent from an authorized phone number. Twilio provides that to us when it sends the message to our API.\n\n* **For international users**: If you have an international phone number and want to send text messages -\n  1. Modify your user record in the DynamoDB Users table with your correct International Phone Number. You need to do this in DynamoDB directly, because the JS chat application performs validation that requires a 10 digit US phone number on the client. After modifying this in DynamoDB, you should be able to send text messages to your Twilio phone number from your international phone number because the the Lambda phone number validation in the code will recognize your phone number.\n\n* * *\n\n## Lab 3 - Search over the chat messages with Elasticsearch Service\n\n**What you'll do in this lab...**\n\nIn this lab you'll launch an Elasticsearch Service cluster and setup DynamoDB Streams to automatically index chat messages in Elasticsearch for future ad hoc analysis of messages.\n\n**Elasticsearch Service Architecture**\n![Overview of Elasticsearch Service Integration](/Images/ElasticsearchServiceOverview.png)\n\n1\\. Select the Amazon Elasticsearch icon from the main console page.\n\n2\\. Create a new Amazon Elasticsearch domain. Provide it a name such as \"[Your CloudFormation stack name]-zombiemessages\". Click **Next**.\n\n3\\. On the **Configure Cluster** page, leave the default cluster settings and click **Next**.\n\n4\\. For the access policy, select the **Allow or deny access to one or more AWS accounts or IAM users** option in the dropdown and fill in your account ID. Your AWS Account ID is actually provided to you in the examples section so just copy and paste it into the text box. Make sure **Allow** is selected for the \"Effect\" dropdown option. Click **OK**.\n\n5\\. Select **Next** to go to the domain review page.\n\n6\\. On the Review page, select **Confirm and create** to create your Elasticsearch cluster.\n\n7\\. The creation of the Elasticsearch cluster takes approximately 10 minutes.\n\n* Since it takes roughly 10 minutes to launch an Elasticsearch cluster, you can either wait for this launch before proceeding, or you can move on to Lab 4 and come back to finish this lab when the cluster is ready.\n\n8\\. Take note of the Endpoint once the cluster starts, we'll need that for the Lambda function.\n![API Gateway Invoke URL](/Images/Search-Step8.png)\n\n9\\. Go into the Lambda service page by clicking on Lambda in the Management Console.\n\n10\\. Select **Create a Lambda Function**.\n\n11\\. On the Blueprints screen select **Blank Function** to create a Lambda function from scratch.\n\n12\\. In Configure Triggers section, select the DynamoDB event source type and then select the **messages** DynamoDB table. It should appear as **\"[Your CloudFormation stack name]-messages\"**. Then set the **Batch size** to **5**, the **Starting position** to **Latest** and select the checkbox **Enable trigger**. Then click on Next button.\n\n13\\. Give your function a name, such as **\"[Your CloudFormation stack name]-ESsearch\"**. Keep the runtime at the default. You can set a description for the function if you'd like.\n\n14\\. Paste in the code from the ZombieWorkshopSearchIndexing.js file provided to you. This is found in the Github repo in the \"ElasticsearchLambda\" folder.\n\n15\\. On [line 6](/ElasticSearchLambda/ZombieWorkshopSearchIndexing.js#L6) in the code provided, replace the **region** variable with the code for the region you are working in (the region you launched your stack, created your Lambda function etc). If you're working in Oregon region, then leave the code us-west-2 as is.\n\nThen on line 7, replace the **endpoint** variable that has a value of **ENDPOINT_HERE** with the Elasticsearch endpoint created in step 8\\. **Make sure the endpoint you paste starts with https://**.\n\n* This step requires that your cluster is finished creating and in \"Active\" state before you'll have access to see the endpoint of your cluster.\n\n16\\. Now you'll add an execution role to your Lambda function which gives permissions for your Lambda function to access AWS resources. For the Role, select **Choose an existing role**, and for the Existing Role, select **\"[Your CloudFormation stack name]-ZombieLabLambdaRole\"** which is the role that was created for you for this workshop. It has permissions to the Elasticsearch service.\n\n17\\. Expand the \"Advanced settings\" section and find the \"Timeout\" field for your Lambda function. In the timeout field, change the function timeout to **1** minute. This ensures Lambda can process the batch of messages before Lambda times out. Keep all the other defaults on the page set as is. Select **Next** and then on the Review page, select **Create function** to create your Lambda function.\n\n18\\. In the above step, we configured [DynamoDB Streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) to capture incoming messages on the table and trigger a Lambda function to push them to our Elasticsearch cluster. Your messages posted in the chat from this point forward will be indexed to Elasticsearch. Post a few messages in the chat, at least 5 as configured in the DynamoDB Streams event source (batch size). You should be able to see that messages are being indexed in the \"Indices\" section for your cluster in the Elasticsearch Service console.\n![API Gateway Invoke URL](/Images/Search-Done.png)\n\n**LAB 3 COMPLETE**\n\nIf you would like to explore and search over the messages in the Kibana web UI that is provided with your cluster, you will need to navigate to the Elasticsearch domain you created and change the permissions. Currently you've configured the permissions so that only your AWS account has access. This allows your Lambda function to index messages into the cluster.\n\nTo use the web UI to build charts and search over the index, you will need to implement an IP based policy to whitelist your computer/laptop/network or for simplicity, choose to allow everyone access. For instructions on how to modify the access policy of an ES cluster, visit [this documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-gsg-configure-access.html). If you choose to open access to anyone be aware that anyone can see your messages, so please be sure to restrict access back to your AWS account when you're done exploring Kibana, or simply delete your ES cluster.  \n\n* * *\n\n## Lab 4 - Slack Integration\n\n**What you'll do in this lab...**\n\nIn this lab, you'll integrate a Slack channel with your survivor chat. There may be survivors who use different chat systems and you'll want to communicate with them! After completing this lab, survivors communicating on Slack can send messages to survivors in the Zombie Chat App by configuring a slash command prefix to be used on any messages in their Slack channel that they want to send to the survivors. When Slack users type messages with this Slash command, it will pass the message to your survivor chat API, similiar to the webhook functionality enabled in the Twilio lab!\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Slack, they offer a free chat communications service that is popular, especially among the developer community. Slack uses a concept called \"Channels\" to distinguish different chat rooms. Visit their website to learn more!\n\n**Slack Integration Architecture**\n![Overview of Slack Integration](/Images/SlackOverview.png)\n\n1\\. Go to [http://www.slack.com](http://www.slack.com) and create a username, as well as a team. If you want to use your existing Slack username and existing team, then proceed with that profile instead of creating a new one.\n\n2\\. Once logged into your Slack team, navigate to [https://slack.com/apps](https://slack.com/apps) which should direct you to the app directory for your team. In the search bar in the middle of the App Directory page, type **slash commands** and select it from the options. This will take you to the Slash Commands portal. \n\n3\\. On the Slash Commands page, click **Add configuration**. \n\nSlash commands allow you to define a command that you can use within Slack to trigger  Slack to perform actions in an event driven manner. In this case we are going to configure a slash command to forward messages to an external source with a webhook. You'll configure your Slash Command to make a POST request to a /zombie/slack API resource you will soon be creating in API Gateway. \n\n4\\. On the Slash Commands configuration page, define a command in the **Commands** text box. Insert **/survivors** as your Slash Command. Then select \"Add Slash Command Integration\" to save it.\n\n5\\. On the Integration Settings page, scroll down to the **Method** configuration andmake sure the **Method** section has \"POST\" selected from the dropdown options. Then scroll to the **Token** section and copy the Token (or generate a new one) to a text file as you'll need it in the following steps.\n\n6\\. Keep the Slack browser tab open and in another tab navigate to the AWS Lambda management console in the AWS Management Console.\n\n7\\. Click **Create a Lambda function**. You'll create a Lambda function to parse incoming Slack messages and send them to the Chat Service.\n\n8\\. On the Blueprints page select **Blank Function** to create a function from scratch. Also skip past the triggers page by selecting **Next**.\n\n9\\. Give your function a name such as **\"[Your CloudFormation Stack name]-SlackService\"**. For the Nodejs version, you can keep the default Nodejs version selected. Now navigate to the GitHub repo for this workshop, or the location where you downloaded the GitHub files to your local machine.\n\n10\\. Open the **SlackService.js** file from the GitHub repo, found in the slack folder. Copy the entire contents of this js file into the Lambda inline edit window.\n\n* This SlackService function will serve as the backend for a new /zombie/slack API resource you will create later. This function accepts incoming messages forwarded from Slack when you use the slash command, it then reformats the parameters and proxies the Slack messages to the zombie survivor chat service (/zombi/message) . This Lambda function verifies that the incoming message has the predefined Slack Token, and it also does a DynamoDB query against the Users table to validate that the user who submitted the message in Slack is a preconfigured survivor in our backend (Remember when you signed up for the chat, you provided your Slack username and team domain as part of the sign-up process). In this workshop, we're using this is as the way to authorize requests against the /zombie/slack resource.\n\n11\\. You should have saved the Slack Token string from earlier. Copy the Token string from Slack into the \"token\" variable on [line 15](/Slack/SlackService.js#L15) in the Lambda function, replacing the string **INSERT YOUR TOKEN FROM SLACK HERE** with your own token.\n\n* Slack provides a unique token associated with your integration. You are copying this token into your Lambda function as a form of validation. When incoming requests from Slack are sent to your API endpoint, and your Lambda function is invoked with the Slack payload, your Lambda function will check to verify that the incoming Token in the request matches the Token you provided in the code. If the token does not match, Lambda returns an error and doesn't process the request.\n\n12\\. There are 4 variables you need to insert in the code to communicate with the backend.\n\na) In the \"API\" variable, you will insert the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your API. The **API.endpoint** variable should show a value of \"INSERT YOUR API GATEWAY FQDN HERE INCLUDING THE HTTPS://\" on [line 9](/Slack/SlackService.js#L9). Your final FQDN inserted into the code should look something like \"https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\". This allows the SlackService function to communicate with your API.\n\nb) You should also fill in the region code in the variable **API.region**. This should be the region where you launched CloudFormation.\n\nc) Finally you will also copy in the name of your DynamoDB Users table that was created for you. This should be placed in the **table** variable. You will also need to copy in the name of your \"slackindex\" (this is an index that was created on the DynamoDB table to assist with querying). These attributes can be found in the Outputs section in CloudFormation. You should be copying the values for **DynamoDBUsersTableName** and **DynamoDBUsersSlackIndex** from CloudFormation.\n\n13\\. After you have copied the code into the Lambda inline code console and modified the variables, scroll down to the **Lambda function handler and role** section. For the role, select **Choose an existing role** from the dropdown and then select the role that looks like **[Your stack name]-ZombieLabLambdaRole...**. For simplicity we are reusing the same Lambda role for our functions.\n\n14\\. In the Advanced Settings, set the **Timeout** to **30** seconds. Then click **Next**.\n\n15\\. On the review page, make sure that everything looks correct.\n\n16\\. Click **Create function**. Your Lambda function will be created.\n\n17\\. When the function is created, navigate to the API Gateway service in the AWS Management Console. Click into your \"Zombie Workshop API Gateway\" API. On the left Resources pane, click/highlight the \"/zombie\" resource so that it is selected. Then select the **Actions** button and choose \"Create Resource\". For Resource Name, insert **slack** and for Resource Path, insert **slack**. Click \"Create Resource\" to create your slack API resource. The final resource for your Slack API should be as shown below.\n![Create Slack API Resource](/Images/Slack-Step17.png)\n\n*  In this step, you are creating a new API resource that the Slack slash command webhook can forward requests to. In the next steps, you'll create a POST method associated with this resource that triggers your Lambda function. When you type messages in Slack with the correct slash command, Slack will send requests to this resource, which will invoke your SlackService Lambda function to pre-process the payload and make a call to your /zombie/message endpoint to insert the data into DynamoDB.\n\n18\\. For your newly created \"/slack\" resource, highlight it, then click **Actions** and select **Create Method** to create the **POST** method for the /zombie/slack resource. In the dropdown, select **POST**. Click the checkmark to create the POST method. On the Setup page, choose an Integration Type of **Lambda Function**, and select the region that you are working in for the region dropdown. For the Lambda Function field, type \"SlackService\" for the name of the Lambda Function. It should autofill your function name. Click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm.\n\n19\\. Click **Integration Request** for the /slack POST method. We'll create a Mapping Template to convert the incoming query string parameters from Slack into JSON which is the format Lambda requires for parameters. This mapping template is required so that the incoming Slack message can be converted to the right format.\n\n20\\. Expand the **Body Mapping Templates** arrow and click **Add mapping template**. In the Content-Type box, enter **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** and click the little checkmark to continue. If a popup appears asking if you would like to secure the integration, click **Yes, secure this integration**. This ensures that only requests with the defined content-types will be allowed.\n\nAs you did in the Twilio lab, we're going to copy VTL mapping logic to convert the request to JSON. A new section will appear on the right side of the screen with a dropdown for **Generate Template**. Click that dropdown and select **Method Request Passthrough**.\n\nIn the text editor, delete all of the exiting VTL code and copy the following into the editor:\n\n```\n{\"body\": $input.json(\"$\")}\n```\n\nClick the grey **Save** button to continue. The result should look like the screenshot below:\n\n![Slack Integration Response Mapping Template](/Images/Slack-Step20.png)\n\n21\\. Click the **Actions** button on the left side of the API Gateway console and select **Deploy API** to deploy your API. In the Deploy API window, select **ZombieWorkshopStage** from the dropdown and click **Deploy**.\n\n22\\. On the left pane navigation tree, expand the ZombieWorkshopStage tree. Click the **POST** method for the **/zombie/slack** resource. You should see an Invoke URL appear for that resource as shown below.\n![Slack Resource Invoke URL](/Images/Slack-Step22.png)\n\n23\\. Copy the entire Invoke URL. Navigate back to the Slack.com website to the Slash Command setup page and insert the Slack API Gateway Invoke URL you just copied into the \"URL\" textbox. Make sure to copy the entire url including \"HTTPS://\". Scroll to the bottom of the Slash Command screen and click **Save Integration**.\n\n24\\. You're ready to test out the Slash Command integration. In the team chat channel for your Slack account, type the Slash Command \"/survivors\" followed by a message. For example, type \"/survivors Please help me I am stuck and zombies are trying to get me!\". After sending it, you should get a confirmation response message from Slack Bot like the one below:\n![Slack Command Success](/Images/Slack-Step24.png)\n\n**LAB 4 COMPLETE**\n\nNavigate to your zombie survivor chat app and you should see the message from Slack appear. You have configured Slack to send messages to your chat app!\n![Slack Command in Chat App](/Images/Slack-Step25.png)\n\n**Bonus Step:**\n\nYou've configured Slack to forward messages to your zombie survivor chat app. But can you get messages sent in the chat app to appear in your Slack chat (i.e.: the reverse)? Give it a try or come back and attempt it later when you've finished the rest of the labs! HINT: You'll want to configure Slack's \"Incoming Webhooks\" integration feature along with a Lambda code configuration change to make POST requests to the Slack Webhook whenever users send messages in the chat app!\n\n* * *\n\n## Lab 5 - Motion Sensor Integration with Intel Edison and Grove\n\nIn this section, you'll help protect suvivors from zombies. Zombie motion sensor devices allow communities to determine if zombies (or intruders) are nearby. You'll setup a Lambda function to consume motion sensor events from an IoT device and push the messages into your chat application.\n\n**IoT Integration Architecture**\n![Zombie Sensor IoT Integration](/Images/EdisonOverview.png)\n\nIf you wish to utilize the Zombie Sensor as a part of the workshop, this guide will walk you through the following:\n\n* Items required to create the physical Zombie sensor (Ignore this step if a zombie sensor is provided as a part of an AWS workshop)\n* How to create the AWS backend (Simple Notification Service Topic) for the Zombie Sensor  \n* How to install the Node.js device code provided in this workshop onto the device\n\n**Please note that this section requires an IoT device that can emit messages to SNS. If you are setting this up on your own device outside of the workshop, please proceed through the sections below to do that, otherwise skip the device setup instructions as the device has been setup by AWS for you by the workshop instructor.**\n\n**Items Required**\n\n1\\. One Intel\u00ae Edison and Grove IoT Starter Kit Powered by AWS. This can be purchased [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0168KU5FK?*Version*=1&*entries*=0).  \n2\\. Within this starter kit you will be using the following components for this exercise:  \n\n* Intel\u00ae Edison for Arduino  \n* Base Shield  \n* USB Cable; 480mm-Black x1  \n* USB Wall Power Supply x1  \n* Grove - PIR Motion Sensor: The application code is a very simple app that publishes a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic when motion is detected on the Grove PIR Motion Sensor. For the purpose of a workshop, this should be done only once in a central account by the workshop organizer - the SNS topic will be made public so that participants can subscribe to this topic and make use of it during the workshop.\n\nAn example output message from the Intel Edison:\n\n``` {\"message\":\"A Zombie has been detected in London!\", \"value\":\"1\", \"city\":\"London\", \"longtitude\":\"-0.127758\", \"lattitude\":\"51.507351\"} ```\n\nA simple workflow of this architecture is:\n\nIntel Edison -> SNS topic -> Your AWS Lambda functions subscribed to the topic.\n\n####Creating the AWS Backend\n\n**If you are following this guide during a workshop presented by AWS, please ignore the steps below, 1-3\\. An SNS topic should already be configured for the workshop participants to consume messages from. That SNS topic ARN will be provided to you.**\n\n1\\. Create the SNS Topic. Navigate to the SNS product page within the AWS Management Console and click **Topics** in the left hand menu. Then click on 'Create New Topic'. You will be presented with the following window. Fill in the fields with your desired values and click create topic.\n![Create Topic Screenshot](/Images/MotionSensor-createTopic.png)\n\n2\\. You will now need to edit the topic policy to permit any AWS account to subscribe lambda functions to your SNS topic. Select the check box next to your new topic, and then click **Actions -> Edit topic policy**. You need to configure these settings presented as shown the below screenshot. Then click **Update Policy**. This part is what allows others (perhaps teammates working on this lab with you, to consume notifications from your SNS topic.\n![Edit Topic Policy Screenshot](/Images/MotionSensor-createTopicPolicy.png)\n\n3\\. You now have your central SNS topic configured and ready to use. Ensure that you make a note of the Topic ARN and region where you have created the topic, you will need it in some of the following steps.\n\n####Installing the application on the Intel Edison\n**If you are following this guide during a workshop presented by AWS, please ignore this section. An Intel Edison board should already be configured for the workshop particants to consume messages from.**\n\n1\\. First, you will need to get your Edison board set up. You can find a getting started guide for this on the Intel site [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/assemble-intel-edison-on-the-arduino-board). Note that for the purpose of this tutorial, we will be writing our client code for the Edison in Node.js and will therefore be using the Intel\u00ae XDK for IoT (referred to as 'XDK' from here on, and which you will need to install) as our IDE.\n\n2\\. You will need to physically connect the Grove PIR Motion Sensor to pin D6 on the breakout board.\n\n3\\. Download all of the code from the 'zombieIntelEdisonCode' folder in the GitHub repository and store it in a folder locally on your machine. This simply consists of a main.js file (our application) and our package.json (our app dependencies).\n\n4\\. Navigate to the homepage in the XDK and start a new project.\n\n5\\. Choose to import an existing Node.js project and select the folder where you stored the code from this repository in the previous step.\n\n6\\. Give your project a name. We called ours **zombieSensor**.\n\n7\\. You now need to edit the code in main.js to include your AWS credentials and the SNS topic that you have created. Firstly, we'll need some AWS credentials.\n\n8\\. You will need to create an IAM User with Access and Secret Access Keys for your Edison to publish messages to your SNS topic. There is a guide on how to create IAM Users [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html). Your IAM policy for the user should look like the following:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [{\n        \"Action\": [ \"sns:Publish\" ],\n        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n        \"Resource\": \"ENTER YOUR SNS TOPIC ARN HERE\"\n    }]\n}\n```\n\n9\\. Now let's add your credentials to the client side code. Edit the following line in main.js to include your user access keys and the region where you have set up your SNS topic.\n\n``` AWS.config.update({accessKeyId: 'ENTER ACCESSKEY HERE', secretAccessKey: 'ENTER SECRET ACCESS KEY HERE', region: 'ENTER REGION HERE'}); ```\n\n10\\. Edit the following line in main.js to reflect the region in which you created the SNS topic.\n\n``` var sns = new AWS.SNS({region: 'ENTER REGION HERE'}); ```\n\n11\\. Edit the following line in main.js to reflect the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic that you created earlier.\n\n``` TopicArn: \"ENTER YOUR SNS TOPIC ARN HERE\" ```\n\n12\\. You now need to connect the XDK to your Intel Edison device. There is a guide on the Intel site on how to do this [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-the-intel-xdk-iot-edition) under the 'Connect to your Intel\u00ae IoT Platform' section.\n\n13\\. You now need to build the app and push it to your device. First, hit the build/install icon, this looks like a hammer in the XDK. It may take a couple of minutes to install the required packages etc.\n\n14\\. Once the app has been built succesfully, you can run the app by pressing the run icon, this looks like a circuit board with a green 'play' sign.\n\n15\\. Your app should now be running on the Edison device and your messages being published to the SNS topic. You can consume these messages using AWS Lambda. There is some documentation to get you started [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-lambda.html). Continue below to learn how to integrate the SNS notifications into the chat application.\n\n####Consuming the SNS Topic Messages with AWS Lambda\n\nUsing the things learned in this workshop, can you develop a Lambda function that alerts survivors in the chat application when zombies are detected from the zombie sensor? In this section you will configure a Lambda function that triggers when messages are sent from the Edison device to the zombie sensor SNS topic. This function will push the messages to the chat application to notify survivors of zombies!\n\n1\\. Open up the Lambda console and click **Create a Lambda function**.\n\n2\\. On the blueprints screen, click **Skip** as we won't use one.\n\n3\\. On the next page (**Configure Triggers**), click the empty field next to the AWS Lambda logo and select SNS as an event source.\n\n![Setup SNS as an Event Trigger for Lambda](/Images/Sensor-Step3.png)\n\n* For the SNS topic selection, either select the SNS topic from the dropdown you created earlier (if you're working on this outside of an AWS workshop) or if you are working in an AWS workshop, insert the shared SNS topic ARN provided to you by the organizer. Make sure the trigger checkbox option is set to enabled so that your Lambda function will immediately begin processing messages. Click **Next**.\n\n* The SNS Topic ARN provided by AWS (if in a workshop) is not in your AWS account and will not display in your dropdown of choices. It is an ARN provided by AWS in a separate account and needs to be typed in.\n\n4\\. On the \"Configure Function\" screen, name your function \"[Your CloudFormation Stack Name]-sensor\". Now open the **exampleSNSFunction.js** file from the workshop GitHub repository. It is located [here](/zombieSensor/lambda/exampleSNSFunction.js). Copy the entire contents of this JS file into the empty Lambda code editor.\n\nWhen you've copied the code into the Lambda browser editor, locate the variable **API**. Replace the variable **API.endpoint** with your /zombie/message/post endpoint. It should look like **https://xxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com**. This is the \"Invoke URL\" which you can grab from the Stages page in the API Gateway console. Remember, don't insert anything after the \".com\" portion, the function fills in the rest of the resource path for you. You also should insert the region for your API in the **API.region** variable.\n\n5\\. For the **Role**, leave the option as **Choose an existing role**. Then in the \"Existing Role\" dropdown, select the ZombieLabLambdaRole that was created for you by CloudFormation. It should look like \"[Your CloudFormation stack name]-ZombieLabLambdaRole\".\n\n6\\. Set the **Timeout** to **30** seconds. Leave all other options as default on the Lambda creation page and click **Next**.\n\n7\\. On the Review page, click **Create function**.\n\n8\\. That's it! When your function is created, head on over to your survivor chat application. If your session has expired you may need to login again.\n\n* Almost immediately you should begin seeing zombie sensor messages showing up in the chat application which means your messages are successfully sending from the Intel Edison device to the Zombie Sensor SNS Topic. Any survivors with Lambda functions subscribed to this topic will get notifications in their team's survivor chat service.  \n\n* This Lambda Function takes the zombie sensor message from SNS, parses it, and makes an AWS SigV4 signed HTTPS POST request to your API Gateway message endpoint. That endpoint inserts the record into DynamoDB as a message making it available to the application on subsequent poll requests.\n\n## Workshop Cleanup\n\n1\\. To cleanup your environment, it is recommended to first delete these manual resources you created in the labs before deleting your CloudFormation stack, as there may be resource dependencies that stop the Stack from deleting. Follow steps 2-6 before deleting your Stack.\n\n2\\. Be sure to delete the TwilioProcessing Lambda Function. Also if you no longer plan to use Twilio, please delete your Twilio free trial account and/or phone numbers that you provisioned.\n\n3\\. Be sure to delete the Elasticsearch cluster and the associated Lambda function that you created for the Elasticsearch lab. Also delete the IAM role you created for the Elasicsearch Lambda function, \"ZombieLabLambdaDynamoESRole\".\n\n4\\. Be sure to delete the Lambda function created as a part of the Slack lab and the Slack API resource you created. Also delete Slack if you no longer want an account with them.\n\n5\\. Be sure to delete the SNS topic (if you created one) and the Lambda function that you created in the Zombie Sensor lab.\n\n6\\. Delete the Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool associated with your application, that you created during lab setup.\n\n* User Pool: Click into your User Pool and click the \"Delete pool\" button to delete your user pool.\n\n* Identity Pool: Click into the Federated Identities page of Cognito and find your identity pool ([stackname]-identitypool). Then click **Edit identity pool**. Scroll to the bottom and delete the identity pool.\n\n7\\. Navigate to CloudWatch Logs and make sure to delete unnecessary Log Groups if they exist.   \n\n8\\. Once those resources have been deleted, go to the CloudFormation console and find the Stack that you launched in the beginning of the workshop, select it, and click **Delete Stack**.\n\n* When the stack has been successfully deleted, it should no longer display in the list of Active stacks. If you run into any issues deleting stacks, please notify a workshop instructor or contact [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) for additional assistance.\n\n* * *\n\n## Appendix\n\n* Channel Challenge: Currently all messages sent in the survivor app are saved in the database with a channel of 'default' - all survivors can see these messages. Your challenge is to modify the application so that users have the option to scope their messages to only display to survivors in the same \"Camp\" (Camp is an attribute that is collected from users when they sign up for a user account). You will need to modify the JS application as well as the backend messages database and Lambda functions to work with this \"Camp\" attribute instead of the existing 'channel' attribute.\n"

  "language": "Ruby",
  "readme_contents": "# ZombieWriter\n\n![Logo](zombie_writer_logo.png)\n\nZombieWriter is a Ruby gem that will enable users to generate news articles by aggregating paragraphs from other sources.\n\nWhile you have to provide the paragraphs, ZombieWriter will arrange the paragraphs into different articles for you to use and edit to your heart's content. You may choose between Machine Learning (Latent Semantic Analysis and k-means clustering) or Randomization.\n\nFor more information about how this program works, please read the blog post [Using Machine Learning To Generate Human-Readable News Articles](https://dev.to/tra/using-machine-learning-to-generate-human-readable-news-articles).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Command Line\n\n```\ngem install zombie_writer\n```\n\n### Gemfile\n\n```ruby\ngem 'zombie_writer'\n```\n\n### Additional Requirements\nZombieWriter also requires [GNU GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl) and [rb-gsl](https://rubygems.org/gems/rb-gsl) (a Ruby gem that interfaces with the GSL library). Please see [Issue #5](https://github.com/tra38/ZombieWriter/issues/5) for more information.\n\n## Usage\nFirst, decide whether you want to use ZombieWriter::MachineLearning or ZombieWriter::Randomization. ZombieWriter::MachineLearning uses Latent Semantic Analysis and k-means clustering to group your content into different articles, while Randomization simply pick random paragraphs to put in each article.\n\nZombieWriter::MachineLearning has the potential of producing better-quality articles, but is slightly slower than ZombieWriter::Randomization.\n\nTo create a MachineLearning zombie...\n```ruby\nzombie = ZombieWriter::MachineLearning.new\n```\n\nAnd to create a Randomization zombie...\n```ruby\nzombie = ZombieWriter::Randomization.new\n```\n\nThen, once you have your zombie, add your content.\n```ruby\nzombie.add_string(content: \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\",\nsourcetext: \"Cicero's Great Speech On Ethics\",\nsourceurl: \"http://example.com/lorem-ipsum\")\n```\n\nIn the generated article, this content will appear in Markdown as:\n```markdown\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet.--[Cicero's Great Speech On Ethics](http://example.com/lorem-ipsum)\n```\n\nIf your content is located in an external file, such as a CSV file, you can easily automate the process of adding strings to your zombie.\n\n```csv\nContent,SourceText,SourceUrl\n\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\",\"Cicero's Great Speech On Ethics\",\"http://example.com/lorem-ipsum\"\n\"Leverage agile frameworks.\",\"Corporate Ipsum\",\"http://www.cipsum.com/\"\n\"Bacon ipsum dolor amet.\",\"Bacon Ipsum\",\"http://baconipsum.com/\"\n\"Pork belly seitan photo booth.\",\"Hipster Ipsum\",\"https://hipsum.co/\"\n```\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'smarter_csv'\n\narray_of_paragraphs = SmarterCSV.process(\"ipsum_quotes.csv\")\n\narray_of_paragraphs.each do |paragraph|\n  zombie.add_string(paragraph)\nend\n```\n\nOnce you have finished giving your Zombie all the strings it needs, tell it to generate your articles. It will save them as an array, which you can then save elsewhere. Each article is numbered, starting from zero, and is also given an headline (which is the \"most important sentence\" in the article). All articles are formatted using Markdown.\n\n```ruby\narray = zombie.generate_articles\n\nFile.open(\"articles.md\", \"w+\") do |f|\n  array.each { |article| f.puts(\"#{article}\\n\\n- - -\\n\") }\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example article that might be generated by ZombieWriter:\n\n```markdown\n## 0 - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet.---[Cicero's Great Speech On Ethics](http://example.com/lorem-ipsum)\n\nBacon ipsum dolor amet.---[Bacon Ipsum](http://baconipsum.com/)\n\nLeverage agile frameworks.---[Corporate Ipsum](http://www.cipsum.com/)\n\nPork belly seitan photo booth.---[Hipster Ipsum](https://hipsum.co/)\n\n- - -\n```\n\n### Citation\nYou do not need to provide sourcetext or sourceurl. If you exclude the sourceurl, the article will only display the sourcetext as citation (with no hyperlink).\n\n```ruby\nzombie.add_string(content: \"This is some Lorem filler that my friend made up.\",\nsourcetext: \"tra38's anonymous friend\")\n```\n\n```markdown\nThis is some Lorem filler that my friend made up.---tra38's anonymous friend\n```\n\nIf you exclude the sourcetext, the article will use the sourceurl, while providing a hyperlink as well.\n\n```ruby\nzombie.add_string(content: \"Zombie ipsum reversus ab viral inferno.\",\nsourceurl: \"http://www.zombieipsum.com\")\n```\n\n```markdown\nZombie ipsum reversus ab viral inferno.---[http://www.zombieipsum.com](http://www.zombieipsum.com)\n```\n\nIf you exclude both the sourcetext and the sourceurl, the article will display no citation. This is useful for situations where you don't need to provide any citation metadata (such as if you have handwritten the content).\n```ruby\nzombie.add_string(content: \"This is filler text that I invented.\")\n```\n\n```markdown\nThis is filler text that I invented.\n```\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\n### NaNoGenMo articles\nThe \"National Novel Generation Month\" competition has generated a lot of commentary on the Internet. Rather than hand-writing out new commentary, why not reuse existing ones?\n\n- [Articles generated using ZombieWriter::MachineLearning](https://gist.github.com/tra38/aa7e9c63708f6e21c32db5c3616162b5)\n- [Articles generated using ZombieWriter::Randomization](https://gist.github.com/tra38/a65408790642560498aa1d40a05be9fe)\n\nIn both instances, we used [this CSV file](https://gist.github.com/tra38/805003ef51ff63093b3c2775f161ce3c) as source data.\n\n## Development\n\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec zombie_writer` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.\n\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Fork it ( https://github.com/tra38/ZombieWriter/fork )\n2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)\n3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')\n4. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)\n5. Create a new Pull Request\n\n## License\n\nThe gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Credits\nThe name is inspired by the term \"[Philosphical Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie)\". According to Wikipedia, a P-Zombie is \"a hypothetical being that is indistinguishable from a normal human being except that it lacks conscious experience, qualia, or sentience\". AI is the closest we can get to building a P-Zombie of our own.\n\nThe logo for this project was generated using [MarkMaker](http://emblemmatic.org/markmaker/#/)."

  "readme_contents": "= Zombie Escape\n\n== About\nThe game is simple... RUN! There are 2 teams: The Humans and the Zombies. The Humans' objective is to run and parkour through maps to get to the 'nukeroom'. (This is a round win for the Humans.) The Zombies' goal is to infect humans before they reach the nukeroom. Each team has unique kits and abilities that suit multiple play styles.\n\n== Downloads\nYou can download development builds [[http://ci.playmc.cc/job/ZombieEscape/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/ZombieEscape.jar|Click Here]]\n\n//Please note development builds are considered unstable, and should only be used for testing!//\n\nOfficial releases will appear in the \"Releases\" tab on the repository located [[https://www.github.com/sgtcaze/ZombieEscape|Click Here]].

  "readme_contents": "# Unity Zombie Defence FPS Example\nThis is the example of zombie defence fps game. Kill the zombies to obtain the cash and upgrade your weapon or buy powerful weapons!\n\nLive Demo: [http://modernator.me:5001/](http://modernator.me:5001/)\n\n## Screenshots\n![screenshot1](screenshot1.png)\n![screenshot2](screenshot2.png)\n![screenshot3](screenshot3.png)\n![screenshot4](screenshot4.png)\n\n## Features\n- Extended Standard FPSController: Recoil, Fixing Jump related glitches\n- Weapon Sway, Weapon Bobbing\n- Endless Zombie offense\n- Used Unity's NavMeshAgent for Path finding\n- Weapon Buying System\n- Weapon Upgrading System\n- Raycast Shooting System(Feat. Shotgun)\n- Raycast Environment interaction(Shops)\n- Global Asset managers (Prefab/Sprite/Sound/Globalsound Managers)\n- All models were made and rigified from Blender(Except zombie prefab from Asset store)\n\n\n## Why it has unused \"multiplayed\" related scripts?\nBecause I want to make this game online, but I gave up. I realized that I need more study about them, but some of the script can be useful for later use.\nThat's because I remained unusing network related resources.\n\n\n## Control\n- WASD: Basic movements\n- R: Reloading\n- M1/Ctrl: Fire\n- M2: Aiming\n- L-Shift: Sprinting\n\n\n## Gameplay rule\n- You start with Police 9mm pistol.\n- After 10 seconds you entered the game, zombies will spawn and it keeps going on until you are dead.\n- Killing a zombie gives you some cash and experience.\n- Collect the cash and buy new gun, or upgrade them, or buy some ammunition.\n- It's endless survival game. Enemies are getting stronger and stronger, also gives more funds and exps.\n\n\n## Rules and Tips\n- Experience is useless system. Just ignore it.\n- Each weapon has own upgrade factors and different upgrade cost & ammo cost. Spend it wisely.\n- Upgrading weapon has limitation. You can only upgrade to LV10 of each.\n- While you are aiming, you gain much more high accuracy, but you lost some speed.\n- All headshot gives 3x damage. Try to aim the head!\n- Every 50 seconds, enemy will getting tough and stronger. Don't forget to upgrade your weapon damage or get some more powerful weapon!\n- Weapon upgrade is not sharing for all weapons. Don't confuse.\n- Zombie has an \"attackable\" angle sight. If you are get closed enough to being attacked, but zombie is not facing to you directly, he can't attack you and try to rotate to face you.\n- Reduce recoil upgrade helps you shoot enemy more precisely. This upgrade especially good for automatic weapons, like MP5K and AKM.\n- M870(Defender Shotgun) fires 8 bullets once, so it has great benefit of damage upgrade. You can easily kill the zombie with single headshot for a long time, without damage upgrade.\n- AKM(Stov Rifle) is most powerful weapon in this game, also it's most expensive. It has 30 round magazine, and easily kill the zombie with 2-3 headshot. But it has huge firing recoil, so you should buy some reduce recoil upgrades.\n- MP5K(Compakt PDW) is most cheapest primary weapon. It has 25 magazine and has very high fire rate, but also has weakness damage in this game. It has cheap ammo cost and upgrade cost, but I'm not recommend to use this weapon for a long time.\n- Police 9mm Pistol(Glock) is starting weapon and it's only one secondary weapon. It means any weapon you buy, you still can use pistol. Pistol has cheapest ammo price and upgrade cost.\n\n\n## Bugs & Improvements\nPlease write the issue on the github page when you found bugs. But I have no plan to improve this game, because this game is just for demonstration.\n\n## Donate me\nAll my tutorials and projects are made for help people who want to learn. Your donation make me keep doing this :)\n\nYou can support my projects by donating me:\n\n[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PVXTU5FJNBLDS)\n"

Two online players can defend and attack as *Plant* and *Zombie* respectively.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Install [*Visual Studio 2022*](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).\n- Install [*CMake*](https://cmake.org).\n- Set the `PATH` environment variables.\n\n### Building\n\nSet the location to the project folder and run:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\ncmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -A Win32\ncmake --build .\n```\n\nTwo dynamic-link libraries `plant.dll` and `zombie.dll` will be generated in `build/bin` folder. Copy them to the game root folder.\n\n#### IPv6\n\nThe default *IP* version is *IPv4*. Enable the following statement in `libs/game/CMakeLists.txt` if you want to build *IPv6* libraries.\n\n```cmake\ntarget_compile_definitions(game PRIVATE INET6=1)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n> The project only works with *Plants vs. Zombies **1.0.0.1051 CHINESE*** version, provided in `game` folder.\n>\n> The *MD5* of `PlantsVsZombies.exe` is `37B729B4056131722A556E646AC915E9`.\n\nIn order to activate online functions, `plant.dll` and `zombie.dll` must be injected into the game when it starts. You can directly use this simple injection tool: [*Dll-Injector*](https://github.com/Zhuagenborn/Dll-Injector).\n\n![online-battle](docs/images/online-battle.gif)\n\n### Playing as Plant\n\nIf a player plays as the plant, the game will launch as a server.\n\n```bash\nDll-Injector -f PlantsVsZombies.exe plant.dll\n```\n\nOr use `Start-OnlineGame.ps1` directly. It needs to be copied to the game root folder.\n\n```powershell\nStart-OnlineGame.ps1 -Role Plant\n```\n\nStart *I, Zombie Endless* level, the game will pause and wait for a client to connect.\n\n### Playing as Zombie\n\nIf a player plays as the zombie, the game will launch as a client.\n\n```bash\nDll-Injector -f PlantsVsZombies.exe zombie.dll\n```\n\nOr use `Start-OnlineGame.ps1`.\n\n```powershell\nStart-OnlineGame.ps1 -Role Zombie\n```\n\nStart *I, Zombie Endless* level, the game will try to connect to the server.\n\n### I, Zombie Endless\n\nIf the modification has been loaded successfully, ***I, Zombie Endless*** level will be converted into an online level. If your current progress does not have this level, you can copy `game/userdata` to `C:\\ProgramData\\PopCap Games\\PlantsVsZombies\\userdata`. Remember to back up your own save-files before copying.\n\nIn the Chinese version of the game, you can start this level as follows:\n\n1. Select \"*\u89e3\u8c1c\u6a21\u5f0f*\", which means \"*Puzzle*\" in English.\n\n    ![puzzle-mode](docs/images/puzzle-mode.png)\n\n2. Select \"*\u6211\u662f\u50f5\u5c38\u65e0\u5c3d\u7248*\", the final level. It is \"*I, Zombie Endless*\" in English.\n\n    ![i-zombie-endless](docs/images/i-zombie-endless.png)\n\n3. The game will display a dialog box shown as below. Select \"*\u7ee7\u7eed*\", the left button, meaning \"*Continue*\" in English.\n\n    ![continue-or-new-game](docs/images/continue-or-new-game.png)\n\n    Before starting an online battle, the progress of this level must be empty. Otherwise the battlefields of two online players will be different. If that happens, you need to restart the game without the modification, enter this level again but select \"*\u65b0\u6e38\u620f*\", the right button, to reset the progress. It means \"*New Game*\".\n\n### Configurations\n\nCopy `online_config.ini` to the game root folder. You can set the server's IP address and port number in it.\n\n```ini\n[Network]\nServerIP=127.0.0.1\nPort=10000\n```\n\n## Documents\n\nThe code comment style follows the [*Doxygen*](http://www.doxygen.nl) specification.\n\n`docs/Key Data and Functions.md` describes key data and functions obtained by reverse engineering.\n\nThe class diagram is created by [*PlantUML*](https://plantuml.com). See `docs/class-diagram.plantuml` for more details.\n\n![class-diagram](docs/class-diagram.png)\n\n## Issues & Bugs\n\n- The game sometimes crashes when creating zombies.\n- If the progress of *I, Zombie Endless* level is not empty, two players will have different battlefields.\n- In order to simplify the code, the running menu and automatic pause are disabled.\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the *MIT License*.

Specifically the paragraph labelled \"purpose two\".\n\nTo recap:  Many C# classes in the `UnityEngine` namespace act as wrappers to instances of corresponding C++ classes, which hold the actual data.  The class `UnityEngine.GameObject` is an example.  Zombie objects are instances of these C# classes that have outlived their C++ counterpart.  The C++ instances are destroyed in an entirely deterministic fashion, for example on scene transition.  On the other hand the C# instances are garbage collected just like any other C# object.  This means that there is an opportunity for the C# object to remain in existence by being referenced by other objects, static variables, etc.\n\n\n## How this tool determines Zombie Objects\n\nThe tool attempts to traverse every instance of every class.  From any one object, it uses reflection to obtain every field of that object, and simply recurses into each one.  It does this until it has examined every object in memory.\n\nAn object is considered a zombie if it satisfies all of the following criteria:\n* It is not *actually* null.\n* It is a subclass of `UnityEngine.Object`.\n* When you compare it to null using `(obj as UnityEngine.Object) == null`, it returns `true`.\n\n# Installation\n\n* Install the package using the Unity Package Manager window, using `Add Package from Git URL`.\n\nThis repository contains an example project that contains various examples of Zombie objects.  These examples are simple and easy to fix.  In larger projects this is not always the case. This tool will help you find them, and give you a trace of where and what is keeping them alive. \n\n\n# Credits\n\nThe project was started by Stewart McCready ([@StewMcc](https://github.com/StewMcc)) during his internship at Unity, with subsequent work by Peter Pimley ([@peter-pimley-unity](https://github.com/peter-pimley-unity)).\n"

  "readme_contents": "Zombie Dice Simulator\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nA simulator for the dice game Zombie Dice that can run bot AI players.\r\n\r\nZombie Dice is a quick, fun dice game from Steve Jackson Games. The players are zombies trying to eat as many human brains without getting \u201cshotgunned\u201d by the humans. On their turn, a player will randomly select three dice from a cup of thirteen dice and roll them. The die faces are brains, footsteps, and shotguns. You get one point per brain, but if you roll a cumulative three shotguns, you\u2019ve been shotgunned and get zero points for your turn. You can then decide to re-roll or pass your turn to the next player. If a die came up as \u201cfootsteps\u201d, it\u2019s used again if the player decides to re-roll. (The player always uses three dice for each roll.) Zombie Dice has a \u201cpush your luck\u201d game mechanic: the more times you choose to re-roll the dice, the more brains you can get but the more likely you\u2019ll collect three shotguns. The game continues until a player reaches 13 brains, and then the rest of the players get one more turn. The dice are colored green (brains are more likely), red (shotguns are more likely), and yellow (brains and shotguns are even).\r\n\r\nMore complete rules for Zombie Dice can be found here:\r\n\r\n* `PDF of the rules in English <http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/img/ZDRules_English.pdf>`_\r\n* `Animated Flash demo of how to play <http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/demo.html>`_\r\n* `Instructables article with the rules <https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-play-Zombie-Dice/>`_\r\n* `YouTube video of someone explaining the rules <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xodehimqCVs>`_\r\n\r\nThis simulator is useful for beginner/intermediate programming lessons or contests. The API for making bots is simple, and it features a web UI for projecting a nifty display of the tournament as it runs.\r\n\r\n.. image:: screenshot.png\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTo install, run the usual ``pip install zombiedice`` (on Windows) or ``pip3 install zombiedice`` (on macOS/Linux).\r\n\r\nYou can view a demo with some pre-made bots by running ``python -m zombiedice`` (on Windows) or ``pip3 install zombiedice`` (on macOS/Linux).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can run ``import zombiedice; zombiedice.demo()``\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to create your own zombie. This is done by creating a class that implements a ``turn()`` method (called when it is your zombie's turn). The ``turn()`` method either calls the ``zombiedice.roll()`` function if you want to roll again, or returns to signal the end of their turn. The ``turn()`` method accepts one argument of the game state (documented later on this page). This class should also have a ``'name'`` attribute that contains a string of the player name. (This is so that the same class can be used for multiple players in a game.)\r\n\r\nThe ``zombiedice.roll()`` function returns a list of dictionaries. The dictionaries represent the dice roll results; it has a ``'color'`` and ``'icon'`` keys, which have possible values of ``'green'``, ``'yellow'``, ``'red'`` and ``'shotgun'``, ``'brains'``, and ``'footsteps'`` respectively. The list will contain three of these dictionaries for the three dice roll results. If the player has reached three shotguns or more, this list will be empty.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a zombie that keeps rolling until they've reached two shotguns, then stops. More example zombies can be found in *examples.py* in the *zombiedice* package::\r\n\r\n\r\n    class StopsAt2ShotgunsZombie(object):\r\n        \"\"\"This bot keeps rolling until it reaches 2 shotguns.\"\"\"\r\n        def __init__(self, name):\r\n            self.name = name\r\n\r\n        def turn(self, gameState):\r\n            shotgunsRolled = 0\r\n            while shotgunsRolled < 2:\r\n                results = roll()\r\n\r\n                if results == []:\r\n                    # Zombie has reached 3 or more shotguns.\r\n                    return\r\n\r\n                for i in results:\r\n                    # Count shotguns in results.\r\n                    if i[ICON] == SHOTGUN:\r\n                        shotguns += 1\r\n\r\nNext, you need to run a tournament. Create a file that calls either ``zombiedice.runWebGui()`` (for the nice web GUI) or ``zombiedice.runTournament()`` (for the plain command line interface). A typical file will look like *demo.py* in the `repo <https://github.com/asweigart/zombiedice>`_::\r\n\r\n    import zombiedice\r\n\r\n    zombies = (\r\n        zombiedice.examples.RandomCoinFlipZombie(name='Random'),\r\n        zombiedice.examples.MonteCarloZombie(name='Monte Carlo', riskiness=40, numExperiments=20),\r\n        zombiedice.examples.MinNumShotgunsThenStopsZombie(name='Min 2 Shotguns', minShotguns=2)\r\n        # Add any other zombie players here.\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # Uncomment one of the following lines to run in CLI or Web GUI mode:\r\n    #zombiedice.runTournament(zombies=zombies, numGames=1000)\r\n    zombiedice.runWebGui(zombies=zombies, numGames=1000)\r\n\r\nThe ``gameState`` parameter for your zombie's ``turn()`` method is passed a dictionary of the state of the game. It's a dictionary with the following keys:\r\n\r\nThe ``'SCORES'`` key's value is a dictionary of Zombie string names mapped to their integer scores.\r\n\r\nThe ``'CURRENT_ZOMBIE'`` key's value is a string of the zombie whose turn it is currently.\r\n\r\nThe ``'CURRENT_CUP'`` key's value is a list of dice strings (i.e. 'red', 'yellow', 'green') for how many of each dice are left in the cup.\r\n\r\nThe ``'SHOTGUNS_ROLLED'`` key's value is an integer of how many shotguns have been rolled so far this turn.\r\n\r\nThe ``'BRAINS_ROLLED'`` key's value is an integer of how many brains have been rolled so far this turn.\r\n\r\nThe ``'ROLLED_BRAINS_DETAILS'`` key's value is a list of dice strings (i.e. 'red', 'yellow', 'green') for each brain rolled, used in the rare event we run out of brain dice.\r\n\r\nThe ``'TURN_START_TIME'`` key's value is a float of the Unix epoch time since the current turn began.\r\n\r\nYou can see examples of how ``gameState`` is used in the Zombie classes in the provided examples.py file.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample Zombies\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThere are a few example zombies included with the module:\r\n\r\n* ``zombiedice.examples.RandomCoinFlipZombie(name)`` - Randomly decides 50/50 whether to continue rolling or quit.\r\n* ``zombiedice.examples.MinNumShotgunsThenStopsZombie(name, minShotguns)`` - Keeps rolling until it rolls the minimum number of shotguns specified.\r\n* ``zombiedice.examples.MinNumShotgunsThenStopsOneMoreZombie(name, minShotguns)`` - Like MinNumShotgunsThenStopsZombie, except it will roll one more time.\r\n* ``zombiedice.examples.HumanPlayerZombie(name)`` - Calls input() to let a human player play against the bots.\r\n* ``zombiedice.examples.RollsUntilInTheLeadZombie(name)`` - Keeps rolling until they are in first place.\r\n* ``zombiedice.examples.MonteCarloZombie(name, riskiness, numExperiments)`` - Does a number of monte carlo simulation (``numExperiments``) to determine what will happen if they roll again. As long as the percentage of simulations resulting in three shotguns is less than ``riskiness``, it will roll again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n----\r\n\r\nMore details about how this module works to come."

To kill a zombie, we have the choice between different weapons:\n\n  * `Hoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::decapitate`, *ziip*;\n  * `Hoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::bludgeon`, *tap tap*;\n  * `Hoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::burn`, if you are cold;\n  * `Hoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::explode`, *boom*;\n  * `Hoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::cutOff`, sausage?\n\nAll these methods have been proven. Thus:\n\n```php\n// I'm alive!\nHoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::fork();\n// I'm a zombie!\nHoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::decapitate();\n// I'm dead\u2026\n```\n\nBut we have to run the script behind FastCGI, that is why we will use the\n[`Hoa\\Fastcgi` library](https://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Library/Fastcgi) in the\nfollowing example.\n\nIn the `Zombie.php` file, we write the following instructions:\n\n```php\necho 'I guess I am sick\u2026', \"\\n\";\nHoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::fork();\n\n// Do whatever you want here, e.g.:\nsleep(10);\nfile_put_contents(\n    __DIR__ . DS . 'AMessage',\n    'Hello from after-life\u2026 or somewhere about!'\n);\nHoa\\Zombie\\Zombie::decapitate();\n```\n\nThen, in the `Run.php` file, we write:\n\n```php\n$fastcgi = new Hoa\\Fastcgi\\Responder(\n    new Hoa\\Socket\\Client('tcp://127.0.0.1:9000')\n);\necho $fastcgi->send([\n    'GATEWAY_INTERFACE' => 'FastCGI/1.0',\n    'REQUEST_METHOD'    => 'GET',\n    'SCRIPT_FILENAME'   => __DIR__ . DS . 'Zombie.php'\n]);\n```\n\nAnd finally, we can test:\n\n```sh\n$ php-fpm -d listen=127.0.0.1:9000\n$ php Run.php\nI guess I am sick\u2026\n```\n\nAnd 10 seconds after, we will see the `AMessage` file appear with the content:\n*Hello from after-life\u2026 or somewhere about!*.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe\n[hack book of `Hoa\\Zombie`](https://central.hoa-project.net/Documentation/Library/Zombie)\ncontains detailed information about how to use this library and how it works.\n\nTo generate the documentation locally, execute the following commands:\n\n```sh\n$ composer require --dev hoa/devtools\n$ vendor/bin/hoa devtools:documentation --open\n```\n\nMore documentation can be found on the project's website:\n[hoa-project.net](https://hoa-project.net/).\n\n## Getting help\n\nThere are mainly two ways to get help:\n\n  * On the [`#hoaproject`](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#hoaproject)\n    IRC channel,\n  * On the forum at [users.hoa-project.net](https://users.hoa-project.net).\n\n## Contribution\n\nDo you want to contribute?

  "readme_contents": "# Zombieland Mod (RimWorld)\n\n## About\n\nDo you like The Walking Dead? Are you afraid of The Undead? Good. Because this mod will give you the Heebie-jeebies!\n\nThis is not your average Zombie mod. In Zombieland, Zombies are everywhere! They crawl out of the ground in masses, hunt you down, bash your doors and eat you alive! At night, their blood lust will steer them towards your base. So better be prepared!\n\nZombies attack anything that moves, smells and makes sounds. They do not discriminate and attack your animals, your enemies and even traders. There are rumors of maps with well over one thousand zombies. Shoot them and they keep going, kill them and they respawn.\n\nThis Mod features custom controlled Zombies with simulated instincts. Most default RimWorld functions have been disabled on them to allow for a smooth game play experience. Therefore, you cannot select or harvest them.\n\n## Design and goal\n\nWith zombies in Zombieland you won't get the normal planing and attacking behaviour like with other mods. Zombies are dumb, get stuck and in general slowly radiate towards your base than to attack it. There are exceptions though: special zombies (depending on type) are smarter and will find you but the big masses just wander around. When they hear, see or smell you they will start following your trail and if one zombie starts to track that way others around it will follow thus resulting in a group behaviour that you would expect from animal packs.\n\nSo when you see that zombies get stuck in a cave or near your base, don't get fooled in underestimating the danger. You can use the mechanics to your advantage too. Try to kite them around or lead them away while another colonist rescues someone. In general, zombies add a chaotic moment to your base Rimworld experience that changes the game substantially. If you expect normal gameplay you will be disappointed. \n\n## Handling Settings\n\nThere are 4 ways to edit settings in Zombieland.\n\n**Default settings**: If you go from the main RimWorld menu and select Options->Mod Settings->Zombieland defaults, you can set the defaults for all new colonies you will start. \n\n**Initial game settings**: When you start a new colony, the settings dialog will appear after the world is generated. It will be prefilled with the settings you have defined in the default settings.\n\n**In-game settings***: While playing, you can choose Menu->Zombieland and edit the current games settings. They will apply immediately and will be saved together with the game when you save it (don't forget to save!).\n\n**Cloud settings**: While in the Zombieland settings dialog, you can load and save your current settings with the **Download** and **Publish** buttons. Publishing will ask you for a name and a description and will save the settings with your steam name. Downloading presents you with a search dialog where you can search for steam user name or settings name. You can see and download other steam user settings too.\n\n## Settings Options\n\nZombieland has a huge amount of customization, so lets go through all options:\n\n### When do zombies appear?\n\n**All the time**  \nNo restriction\n\n**When it is dark**  \nZombies will spawn at cells that are considered dark. This can be during night or anywhere where there is no light. Lit areas will prevent zombies from spawning, even at night\n\n**Only as events**  \nIn this mode, zombies will come in groups and the center of the group spawn is random but follows the next setting\n\n### From where do zombies come? \n\n**Where there is soft ground**  \nThey will spawn anywhere on the map but only if there is no hard ground and you did not build any floor or wall there. Some mods introduce new types of ground/floors and Zombieland tries to do its best to identify them\n\n**From the map edges**  \nThe classic way raiders or visitors appear in RimWorld\n\n### What will zombies attack?\n\n**All creatures**  \nNo restrictions\n\n**Human-like creatures**  \nAll humans (mods that introduce robots usually make them based on humans, there is no easy way for Zombieland to see that they are not)\n\n**Only colonists**  \nJust your beloved settlers\n\n**Enemies attack zombies**  \nMake your raiders fight zombies or let them try to ignore them as long as possible\n\n**Animals attack zombies**  \nMake any animal on the map fight zombies (if they are a predator or have to fight back) or let them ignore them\n\n### What will zombies destroy?\n\n**Nothing**  \nZombies leave your things alone\n\n**Only doors**  \nZombies will attack doors if they are happen to be close to them. \n\n**Everything that was build**  \nZombies will attack anything, even ancient danger walls (surprise!)\n\n**Only when they are agitated**  \nRestrict damaging to zombies that are raging (red eyes; triggered by too large tight groups of zombies)\n\n### Zombie senses\n\nNote: Zombies smell and hear you, even through walls. Weapons will be heard within the shooting range but only if they make clear sounds (bows won't)\n\n**Limited**  \nClose range, roughly 3-5 cells, traces fade away fast\n\n**Normal**  \nNormal range, about 6-9 cells\n\n**Elevated**  \nLarger range, 10 or more cells, traces fade away slowly\n\n**Zombies rage when a group gets too large**  \nMakes extra angry zombies (red eyes) that know where you are and will follow you (and destroy things if previous setting allows it)\n\n**Rage level**  \nThis controls the difficulty of raging. Set to low, raging only occurs in very large groups and does not last long. Set to high, raging will happen in smaller groups and the effect will last longer.\n\n### Zombie health\n\n**Zombies recover from injuries**  \nSince zombies are dead, this will activate slow continuous random injury healing to simulate that they are *undead*\n\n**Zombies are easy to kill**  \nIs Zombieland way to hard to play? This is the #1 option to turn on. The slightest injury will kill zombies and they won't get down but die immediately\n\n### Zombies will eat\n\n**Injured creatures**  \nNormally zombies only start feasting on corpses but turn this on and see your downed colonists being eaten alive!\n\n**Corpses**  \nTurn this off if you don't want zombies to eat anything\n\n### Special zombies\n\nZombieland has six special types of zombies and the rest is either fat and slow or slim and fast.\n\n**Suicide bombers**  \nThey have a explosive vest on their body that explodes when they die or when they get close to your walls\n\n**Toxic splashers**  \nThey consist of toxic goo that will be spread around them when they die. Do not walk over it because it creates toxic buildup and is extremely sticky. Can be cleaned and will wash away when it rains.\n\n**Tanky operators**  \nThese zombies are slow but smart and **very** strong. They will try to reach your walls and will breach them easily. Just like your skull if you get too close to them. Their shield and armor will protect them so make sure you hit them many times with your long range weapons\n\n**Miners**  \nNormal zombies but with a hobby. They like to mine through mountains\n\n**Electric**  \nElectrifying zombies that are shockingly resistent to bullets or ranged weapons. You need to melee them but luckily they don't bite so you don't get infected by them. Their electric field damages everything close by that is electric/electronic - like power lines, appliences, powerarmors, shield belts - basically anything you build out of components.\n\n**Albinos**  \nVery fast zombies that are easy to kill. They go for your doors and sabotage them so they stay open for a bit longer than usual. Will start to scream when getting close to your colonists which makes them vomit so you loose control for a short while.\n\n**Dark puffers**\nWhen hit they produce a big cloud of defensive dark smoke that will prevent you from seeing them and their fellow zombies. They also leave a very sticky tar like substance on the ground that makes moving very hard. \n\n**Healers**\nThese cyan zombies will heal other injured zombies around them. \n\n### New game\n\n**Days until zombies come**  \nTo give you a head start, Zombieland lets you configure the number of days without zombies when you start your colony\n\n### Zombies on the map\n\nNote: the actual number of zombies on a map is calculated by Zombieland based on the game difficulty and the combat ability of your colonists. It takes into account: number of colonists, their weapons, their armor, if they sleep or are injured, if they are away from the map, if they can only do melee, etc...\n\n**Never more than ... zombies**  \nMaximum number of zombies per map. This is a hard upper limit and mainly to prevent the game from lagging too much. Fast computers can deal with 1500 or more zombies\n\n**Colony multiplier**  \nIf you play rich explorer or in general with few colonists and want more zombies, increase this number to get more zombies\n\n### Zombie events\n\nNote: Events with groups of zombies will always appear, even if you play with \"When do zombies appear - all the time\". In that case, less often. Events are spaced out by Zombieland every few days\n\n**Zombies per colonist**  \nThis setting is **only for calculating event size**, not an overall restriction. Events have an internal maximum size (but aim to never exceed the maximum number of zombies on the map) so this setting mainly allows you to *reduce* event size\n\n**Extra days between events**  \nIf events are too frequent for your taste, add a fixed amount of days between them\n\n### Zombie speed\n\nNote: this is the second most useful setting to make Zombieland easier\n\n**If they are calm**  \nNormal zombie speed (fat ones are slower, slim ones are faster)\n\n**If they feel excited**  \nThe speed for agitated, raging red eye zombies\n\n### Zombie strength \n\n**Damage multiplier**  \nZombies deal different amounts of damage (slim/fat). This setting makes it less or more. Zombies always deal a good amount of stun so don't get caught up in a fight with more than 2-3 zombies or you won't be able to fight back\n\n### Game tweaks\n\n**Reduce turret gun consumption**  \nThis will reduce the amount of steal turret guns consume when they fire (100% makes them consume nothing)\n\n### Threat level\nIf you turn on dynamic threat level you will get a threat level forecast that applies to the maximum number of zombies you would normally get. As default you also get that at 0% threat level, all zombies on the map die. You can turn off that and also define how the level changes over time. \n\n### Dead humans turn into zombies**\nIf this is on, every human with a brain will become a zombie after they are dead for the given time period. This will force you to \"double tap\" dead humans like raiders or visitors to preventing their corpses becoming powerful zombies. Double tapping can be controlled per selected colonist with the corresponding widget button. \n\n### Zombie infections\n\nNote: see Infections for more details on how infections in Zombieland work\n\n**Risk that a zombie bite is infectious**  \nOnly zombie bites infect, scratches won't\n\n**Time until infection is known**  \nStage 1) zombie bites won't show a status at the beginning\n\n**Time infection is treatable**  \nStage 2) Once a wound is infected, treatment it will stop the infection. So does amputation (if possible)\n\n**Duration of the infection**  \nStage 3) An unstopped infection will start the conversion to a zombie. At this point hope is almost lost, only amputation (if feasible) is still the last option. Don't kill your colonist because he or she might have zombie-like super powers. At the end of this stage, the colonist becomes a powerful zombie\n\n**Treatment in a bed stops infections**  \nNormally, treatment only works if done by a really good doctor, in a really good medical bed with a vitals monitor in a sterile room. This option makes it work in *any* bed. Please note: if the wound has been treated outside of a bed before, it's too late. You have one chance\n\n### Zombie serum\n\nNote: see Serum for more details on how serum in Zombieland work\n\n**Amount of zombie extract per zombie**  \nHere, you can set how much extract you will get from each zombie corpse\n\n**Hours until zombie corpses disappear**  \nTo reduce the overall impact of all dead zombies on the game, the visuals and your ability to select things, Zombieland lets you configure how fast zombie corpses desiccate and disappear.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n**Use custom textures**  \nMakes all zombies look uniquely shabby but requires more memory\n\n**Change survival meals to Twinkies**  \nA homage to the movie Zombieland!\n\n**Play creepy ambient sound at night**  \nMakes the nights, when zombies tend to wander towards your base, a bit more creepier\n\n**Automatic avoidance of zombies**  \nSince the risk of getting close to a zombie is high, Zombieland can help you continuously reevaluate the path to avoid zombies. Recommended. Downside: sometimes, you might not be able to order colonists close to zombies if you want to\n\nIn addition, you have a button for each colonist where you can turn avoidance on/off at any time. This affects not only pathing but also any action or job that colonist does. If zombies get too close, the job (sleeping, building, shooting) gets shortly interrupted by a quick flee to a better position unless your colonist is drafted in which case you are fully in control of the action. This allows you to configure your colonists with auto-attack to let them fight zombies on their own or let them haul things without worrying too much about them.\n\nElectrical zombies are excluded from avoidance since they don't bite and to allow auto melee attacks (the only way to fight them).\n\n**Zombies drop blood**  \nKeep on for more dramatic visuals but can slow your game down a bit\n\n**Zombies burn longer**  \nIt's more fun to have undead run around burning but you can turn it off\n\n### Actions\n\n**Restore default settings**  \nWill reset the current dialog to the defaults that you have set from the main menu\n\n**Remove Zombieland from current game**  \nWill ask you for a new save file and save a copy of the current game with all references to Zombieland removed\n\n## Serum\n\nYou can collect zombie extract in small amounts from dead zombies and refine it on a drugtable into zombie serum (requires 1x medicine too). The serum comes in qualities of 10% to 100% and they require different amounts of zombie extract. One potion of serum heals one zombie bite and the quality determines the failure risk when doing an operation on an infected colonist. \n\nColonists that are scheduled to do doctor tasks automatically collect zombie extract if there are no zombies nearby but you can order them too. There is a button in the colonist actions that toggles automtic collection on and off.\n\nZombie serum is a very good way to remove a zombie infection regardless of its stage. So try to plan ahead and start collecting it early - gathering enough zombie extract to make serum takes a while.\n\nFor tribal runs you can craft serum on a normal crafting spot by combining medicine and a small animal cadaver. This makes it easier for non-tech runs to get serum. \n\n## Infections\n\nIn Zombieland, only human-like pawns can get infected. That includes any human-like modded pawns that are based on the basic human characters in RimWorld, including most robot mods. Zombieland tests for human flesh and tries its best to reduce this to the actual human forms but it's sometimes not possible.\n\nOnly zombies can infect humans. There is no concept of infected meat or corpses and only zombie bites are infectious. Zombies deal scratches and bites and the risk that a bite is infectious can be set in the settings. Fighting zombies close up in melee is therefore not recommended but with a set low risk doable.\n\nEach bite separately has a predetermined infection status that is hidden at the beginning. The part of the body stays infected unless the wound is treated in an appropriate way or amputated if possible.\n\nInfections go through 3 stages: Unknown, treatable, infecting and after the third stage, the infected human turns into a zombie. The settings define a time interval for each of these stages. If all are set to zero, a bite will instantaneously turn the bitten into a zombie.\n\nStages are marked with colored text in the Health tab of the character. Bites can show up in **white** (no or unknown infection), **orange** (treatable infection) or **red** (fully infecting, only amputation will help). Also, an infected human (or corpse) will have a warning at the bottom of the health overview page.\n\nWhen colonists become infected or go from one stage to the next, Zombieland will generate warning notes on the right hand side of the screen. Do not miss them, they contain useful information about the colonist or the infection.\n\nInfections continue even after death. When a corpse starts rotting, it will become a zombie and get out of the grave if necessary. Raiders or friendly can become infected and when they return, they will become zombies the moment they enter the map.\n\nInfections are quite fatal. Once a colonist is terminal infected and the affected body part cannot be amputated or you don't have any zombie serum, there is almost no hope anymore. Consider it a loss and be more careful next time. **But: Don't kill or amputate stage 3 infected colonists too early!** They might prove more useful than you think: they get zombie like powers and don't need to sleep or eat. And the best is that zombies won't attack them anymore. They are almost part of the zombie family anyway!\n\n## Compatibility\n\nZombieland is a huge and complex mod. It is designed to showcase Harmony, the patch library that powers most Unity game mods. A lot of areas are carefully manipulated but conflicts are impossible to prevent. Especially badly written mods conflict easily with Zombieland. So if no zombies spawn or you cannot treat infected wounds or any other unusual outcome, try playing with Zombieland alone to see if this is a specific bug in the mod or just an incompatibility.\n\nZombieland seems to work best when put at the end of the mod list but you may have to try other positions or mod combinations. Please do not ask me to find the conflict for you because I don't have the knowledge nor the time to test Zombieland with all the mods out there. As a rule of thumb, I also do not adapt Zombieland to specific mods unless the mod is very popular and I can establish some sort of cooperation with the other mod author.\n\n**Existing games**\n\nYou can add Zombieland to existing games but be careful: if your colony already has many powerful colonists, the number of zombies will rise significant since the mod scales zombie numbers to match the defendability of your colony.\n\n**Multiplayer**\n\nZombieland is currently not compatible with multiplayer. It is not very likely that it will be made compatible because of the randomness and optimizations that would prevent running predicably on different computers.\n\n**Combat Extended**\n\nZombieland is compatible with Combat Extended. From time to time there might be small bugs but reporting them to **both** authors in a useful way usually helps.\n\n## License\n\nFree. As in free beer.

  "readme_contents": "Zombsole\n========\n\n.. image:: ./demo.gif\n\nZombsole is a game in which you play **programming** simple bots, which will have \nto survive and fight against hordes of zombies.\n\nThe game is **cooperative**: the idea is to find some friends, each one program a \ndifferent bot, and then put the bots to work together against the zombies.\n\nThere are three different game types:\n\n* **Extermination**: you must kill all zombies, and at least 1 player must survive.\n* **Evacuation**: all players start far away from each other, and must get together\n  to be evacuated at any place by an helicopter. At least half of the team must\n  survive.\n* **Safe House**: all players must travel and get inside a single safe house. At \n  least 1 player must reach it, but to win, all the living players must be \n  inside.\n\nAnd the best of all: is really **simple**.\n\nGetting started\n===============\n\nThe game isn't packaged for PyPI or anything, it's meant to be a playground, so just\nclone the code, install its dependencies, and get inside the ``zombsole`` folder to\nstart messing around:\n\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/fisadev/zombsole.git\n    cd zombsole\n    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n(If you know about virtualenv, use it!)\n\n\nAnd now lets just run a simple demo game:\n\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    ./play.py extermination sniper,troll -n 50 -m to_the_closet\n\nDepending on how lucky you are, this could either keep running forever, or quickly\nend with a very un-gory massacre of the two players (sniper and troll). If you want\nto stop the game, just press ``Ctrl-c``.\n\nThe parameters of the ``play.py`` script are very easy to understand, just run \n``./play.py --help``. In the example we just said \"run an extermination game \nwith the to_the_closet map, the players sniper and troll, and a constant population \nof 50 zombies.\"\n\nThe fun part: how to create your own players\n============================================\n\nTo create a player you need to create a python module inside the ``players`` folder, \nwith your player name as module name. For example ``players/terminator.py``.\n\nInside your player module, you have to define 2 things: a player class and a ``create`` \nfunction.\n\nYour player class\n-----------------\n\nIt should inherit ``things.Player``, and implement a single instance method called\n``next_step``. Something like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from things import Player\n\n\n    class Terminator(Player):\n        '''Liquid metal, invincible.'''\n        def next_step(self, things, t):\n            return 'heal', self\n\n\nThis ``next_step`` method will be called each game instant, so your player can think\nand decide what to do next. The method receives ``things``, which is a dictionary of\nall the things present in the world (the game world, that is. I can't know all the \nthings in the real world, because it's too much time-consuming). In this dictionary,\nthe keys are the positions, and the values are the things in those positions.\n\nExample of ``things`` you can receive:\n\n.. code-block:: \n\n    {   \n        (0, 0): <instance of Zombie>,\n        (0, 1): <instance of Zombie>,\n        (0, 2): <instance of Zombie>,\n        (10, 1): <instance of Wall>,\n        (10, 3): <instance of Wall>,\n        (23, 25): <instance of Box>,\n        (50, 34): <instance of another Player>,\n        (51, 40): <you (self)>,\n    }\n\nThe method also receives ``t``, which is an integer representing the \"instant\" of time, \nin case you want to use that information.\n\nAnd as you can see, the result of ``next_step`` must be a tuple. This tuple has two parts:\nthe first one is the action to do, and the second one is the \"target\" for the action.\nActions can be:\n\n+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| attack    | attack with your weapon, the target must be a ``Thing`` (yourself,        |\n|           | another player, zombie, wall, box...)                                     |\n+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| heal      | heal something, the target must be a ``Thing`` (yourself, another player, |\n|           | zombie, wall, box...)                                                     |\n+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| move      | move to another location, the target must be a position (a tuple of       |\n|           | (x, y))                                                                   |\n+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nIf your bot doesn't feel like doing anything useful, it could also return just None, and no\naction will be performed. He will just stand still, watching as his fellow bots fight endless\nhordes of zombies without his help.\n\nSome extra notes about actions:\n\n* Your weapon has a maximum range, visible at ``self.weapon.max_range``. If you try to shoot \n  things that are farther away, you won't hit them. And you can use the ``distance`` function\n  from the ``utils`` module to calculate distances between points.\n* Healing has a range too (visible at ``core.HEALING_RANGE``).\n* Movement is limited to adjacent tiles. That is, you can only move 1 block either up, down,\n  left or right. If you try to move to anywhere else, you will just stay still.\n\nAnd also, there are other two attributes in your player that can be useful to look at:\n\n* ``self.life``: amount of current life, from 0 (dead) to 100 (healthier than wolverine).\n* ``self.position``: your current position on the map.\n* ``self.rules``: the name of the rules of the game playing.\n* ``self.objectives``: the objective positions of the game playing (can be None).\n\nYour create function\n--------------------\n\nBesides your player class, you had to define a ``create`` function inside your player module.\nThis function must look like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def create(rules, objectives=None):\n        return Terminator('terminator', 'blue', rules=rules, objectives=objectives)\n\n\nThe create function will be the one creating the instance of your player. You can run additional logic\nhere before game starts, and the parameters you receive will tell you the kind of game that will be\nplayed (``rules`` is a string with the name of the rules of the game), and the objectives\nlocations if there are any in the current game rules (Safehouse game mode has objective locations\nthat players must reach. Extermination and Evacuation don't have objective locations).\n\nThe default parameters your ``Player`` instance will need when created are a friendly name (\"terminator\"\nin the example) and a color (blue, cyan, green, grey, magenta, red, white, or yellow). You can also\nspecify the weapon you want to use, importing them from the ``weapons`` module. But don't abuse this,\ntry to keep it challenging (i.er, don't create an army full of shotguns, be humble, it's a zombie apocalypse,\nnot WW3).\n\nAnd finally, your player receives the ``rules`` name and the ``objectives``, to store them and be able to use\nthat info later on the ``next_step``.\n\nCollaborative for the win\n-------------------------\n\nBesides moving, playing doctor and smashing things, your players can communicate with each other! And in a\nquite simple manner. You just have an instance attribute called ``status``, that you can update at any\nmoment from inside your ``next_step`` method. This status is visible to other players, so you can use\nstatus messages to give orders, ask for help, insult players that aren't killing enough zombies, and \nmany more.\n\nYou update your status doing something like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    class Terminator(Player):\n        '''Liquid metal, invincible.'''\n        def next_step(self, things, t):\n            self.status = u'Healing myself, because I am invincible'\n            return 'heal', self\n\nAnd you can see other player statuses with something like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    class Terminator(Player):\n        '''Liquid metal, invincible.'''\n        def next_step(self, things, t):\n            other_players = [thing for thing in things.values()\n                             if isinstance(thing, Player)]\n            for player in other_players:\n                print player.name, 'status is:', player.status\n\n            return 'heal', self\n\n\n**That's it**. That's pretty much everything you need to know to create your own player. And if you want \nto see some inspirational examples, the ``players`` folder already has some simple ones, and even a \nplayer that can be controlled in real time by a human using the keyboard! (but still, Randoman is the \nbest).\n\nBreaking the game\n=================\n\nIn a normal game play, your player instance has references to all the other things in the world.\nThis leaves a **giant** backdoor to hack, that allows you to do stuff like this:\n\n* Put every ``zombie.life`` to 0, effectively killing all zombies with just your thought.\n* Add 300 clones of you to the map (maybe you were some kind of replicant).\n* Replace every zombie's ``next_step`` function with a custom made, and make them obey you.\n* Increase your weapon range and damage.\n* Teleport to any locations.\n* etc..\n\nIf you want a real survival challenge, just don't modify anything in ``things``, and don't modify\nyour ``self.life`` or ``self.position`` (neither your weapon properties).\n\nIf you like a mind control challenge, use all that and create an army of coordinated zombies that\nwrite your player's name in the map by moving boxes.\n\n**Either way, the point is to have fun programming :)**\n\nAnd finally, the game features an advanced isolation mechanism based on `Docker <http://docker.io>`_,\nwhich you could use to effectively forbade any of those hacks in the scenario of some public competence\nor if you are running \"untrusted\" code. This isn't documented yet, but it's functional and quite\nsimple. I promise to add docs in a few days.\n\nCreating maps\n=============\n\nThis is super easy: create a text file under the ``maps`` folder (name without spaces), and use \nthese characters to draw objects and important locations:\n\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| \u2593 or w | a wall                                                                               |\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| \u2612 or b | a box                                                                                |\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| p      | a player spawn point (be sure to add at least 10)                                    |\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| z      | a zombie spawn point (be sure to add **many more**)                                  |\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| o      | an objective location (for safehouse games, be sure to add as many as player spawns) |\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n"

We tried, but this wasn't working well. ZombieBox tries it's best to follow a version policy close to semver that makes sense.\n\n* Major versions denote major changes in code structure and APIs. It's probably either a brand new framework or requires extensive migration if major version changed.\n* Minor versions mean new features. There might be **breaking changes in minor versions**, but they likely require minor migrations like changing methods order, signatures or replacing one component with another equivalent. These should be documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [migratiosn](./docs/migrations) docs.\n* Patch versions do not introduce breaking changes and either fix bugs or add neglectable improvements in non-breaking way.\n* Pre-release versions are meant to contain experimental features that are going to be introduced later and are likely to break compatibility and be generally unstable. These are only pushed to `@dev` dist-tag.\n\nAll ZombieBox components declare their dependencies on each other with `peerDependencies` field in package.json. Node itself does not enforce this field, but ZombieBox does in its CLI commands.\n\n## Behind ZombieBox\n\nZombieBox was developed and is maintained by [Interfaced](https://interfaced.tv).\n\nIt was created as internal framework for numerous Smart TV and STB [applications](https://interfaced.tv/projects.html) developed for industry leaders. \n\n## License\n\nThis library is distributed under MIT license.

A rota e a l\u00f3gica de banco de dados para **excluir uma pessoa**\n1. A rota e a l\u00f3gica de banco para **adicionar uma pessoa**\n1. Implementar a **negoci\u00e7\u00e3o de conte\u00fado** para a listagem de pessoas\n   - Observe como `routes/zombies.js` responde tanto em HTML quanto em JSON e fa\u00e7a algo parecido\n\nTodos os exerc\u00edcios devem ser feitos no arquivo `routes/people.js`, onde\nest\u00e3o definidas todas as rotas relativas ao recurso `person`.\n\nPrimeiramente, fa\u00e7a um _fork_ deste reposit\u00f3rio no GitHub e clone-o\npara seu computador.\n\n\n## Pr\u00e9-requisito: MySQL Server\n\nPara esta pr\u00e1tica, voc\u00ea vai precisar do MySQL, al\u00e9m do\n_setup_ tradicional do Node.js presente nos melhores computadores.\n\nEle pode (1) ser instalado no pr\u00f3prio computador ou (2) ser usado por meio de uma imagem do Docker.\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    (1) Instalando e usando MySQL Server diretamente no host\n  </summary>\n\n  - No Linux (_Debian based_) \u00e9 facinho:\n    ```\n    $ sudo apt-get update\n    $ sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server\n    ```\n    - Neste momento, uma tela sensacional ser\u00e1 aberta perguntando qual a\n      **senha** deve ser atribu\u00edda ao **usu\u00e1rio `root`**. Neste exerc\u00edcio `db.js` espera que seja `123456`\n      - Claro, n\u00e3o fa\u00e7a isso em um servidor web de verdade ;)\n  - No Windows, sugiro baixar o\n    [instalador do MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)\n    no site oficial\n  - No OS X, [eu n\u00e3o sei como fazer :3](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html)\n\n  Quando instalado, o MySQL exp\u00f5e uma CLI (_command line interface_) que \u00e9\n  acess\u00edvel pelo nome de `mysql`. Para verificar que ele est\u00e1 funcionando\n  devidamente e validar este passo do trabalho, execute:\n  ```\n  $ mysql -u root -p\n  ```\n    - Esse comando nos traz para um ambiente onde podemos executar comandos\n    contra os bancos de dados presentes na inst\u00e2ncia do MySQL que acabamos\n    de instalar. Por exemplo:\n    ```\n    $ mysql> show databases;\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    (2) Instalando Docker e usando imagem do MySQL\n  </summary>\n\n  - Instale o Docker [seguindo as instru\u00e7\u00f5es][install-docker] (caso j\u00e1 n\u00e3o esteja instalado)\n  - Construa a imagem Docker representada pelo `Dockerfile` nesta pasta:\n    ```bash\n    sudo docker build -t zombies-db .\n    # ou\n    npm run build-db\n    ```\n    - Ao faz\u00ea-lo, o Docker vai baixar as imagens necess\u00e1rias\n</details>\n\nSe voc\u00ea chegou at\u00e9 aqui, segure na m\u00e3o de Deus e continue.\n\n[install-docker]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n\n\n## Banco de dados\n\nA aplicacao requer um banco de dados MySQL e voc\u00ea deve usar os arquivos dentro de `db-migrations/` para criar uma inst\u00e2ncia do banco com alguns\ndados pr\u00e9-populados.\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    (1) Restaurando banco com MySQL instalado no computador\n  </summary>\n\n  Para isso, em linha de comando:\n\n  ```bash\n  mysql -u root -p < db-migrations/001-create-db-zombies.sql\n  mysql -u root -p < db-migrations/002-populate-zombies.sql\n  ```\n  - Ao faz\u00ea-lo, os _scripts_ em `db-migrations/` devem ter sido executados e o banco criado e populado\n\n  E continue lendo as intru\u00e7\u00f5es...\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    (2) Restaurando banco em container Docker\n  </summary>\n\n  - Ap\u00f3s ter constru\u00eddo a imagem Docker, basta inicializar o _container_ baseado nela:\n    ```bash\n    sudo docker run -d -p 3306:3306 zombies-db\n    # ou\n    npm run start-db\n    ```\n    - Ao faz\u00ea-lo, os _scripts_ em `db-migrations/` devem ter sido executados e o banco criado e populado\n    - Depois disso, voc\u00ea pode verificar se foi criado um _container_ executando:\n      ```bash\n      sudo docker ps\n      ```\n      - \"Anote\" o _container id_\n    - Agora, entre no _container_ para verificar se o banco de fato est\u00e1 l\u00e1:\n      ```bash\n      sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash\n      ```\n    - E continue lendo as intru\u00e7\u00f5es...\n</details>\n\n\n\nPara verificar que tudo est\u00e1 certo como deveria ser:\n\n```bash\n$ mysql -u root -p\nmysql> show databases;\nmysql> use zombies;\nmysql> select * from person;\n```\n- E voc\u00ea deve ver uma lista com algumas pessoas da tabela `person`\n\nCom tudo certo, siga adiante, bravo(a) programador(a).\n\nPara sair: v\u00e1 dando `exit` no console at\u00e9 voltar ao console\nda pasta do projeto.\n\n\n## Instru\u00e7\u00f5es de execu\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nTente executar a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o usando o comando a seguir e repare que n\u00e3o\nfuncionar\u00e1:\n\n```\n$ npm start\n```\n  - O motivo do erro \u00e9 que as depend\u00eancias do projeto ainda n\u00e3o est\u00e3o\n    instaladas\n\nEm seguida, instale as depend\u00eancias do projeto, que j\u00e1 foram definidas no\narquivo `package.json`:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n```\n\nAgora, tente executar novamente. Outra vez, um erro teimoso:\n![](docs/erro-faltando-nodemon.png)\n  - Desta vez, vamos usar um pacote chamado `nodemon` para executar\n    a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, em vez do pr\u00f3prio `node`\n  - Motivo: o `node` fecha sozinho sempre que uma exce\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o tratada \u00e9\n    lan\u00e7ada. O `nodemon` (_node monitor_) executa o programa e d\u00e1 _restart_\n    no Node.js caso ele se encerre abruptamente\n\nInstale de forma global o `nodemon`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g nodemon\n# ou\nnpm i -g nodemon\n```\n\nPara acionar o servidor, voc\u00ea poderia executar `nodemon bin/www.js`. Contudo,\nrepare que o arquivo `package.json` cont\u00e9m uma propriedade `scripts.start`,\ncujo valor \u00e9 exatamente `nodemon bin/www.js`:\n\n![](docs/package-json-scripts-start.png)\n\nSendo assim, basta executar:\n\n```\n$ npm start\n```\n  - ...e o `npm` executar\u00e1 exatamente o que est\u00e1 no `package.json`\n\n\nIsso acionar\u00e1 o `nodemon` e manter\u00e1 o `node` em execu\u00e7\u00e3o para sempre.\nAl\u00e9m disso, o `nodemon` reinicia o servidor sempre que detecta altera\u00e7\u00f5es\nno c\u00f3digo fonte, fazendo com que n\u00e3o seja necess\u00e1rio parar o servidor e\nabri-lo novamente.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    Se der erro de acesso ao banco de dados...\n  </summary>\n\n  Executando novamente a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, nos deparamos com isto:\n  ![](docs/erro-acesso-negado-mysql.png)\n    - Motivo: a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o `cefet-web-zombie-garden` acessa o banco de dados\n      a partir de um certo usu\u00e1rio e senha e esse erro indica que o\n      usu\u00e1rio/senha usados pela aplica\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o est\u00e3o corretos\n\n  Para corrigir este problema, abra o arquivo `db.js` na raiz do projeto\n  e configure devidamente os dados de conex\u00e3o com o banco de dados -\n  possivelmente voc\u00ea deve precisar apenas de colocar a senha do\n  usu\u00e1rio `root` do MySQL.\n</details>\n\n\nAo executar a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o:\n\n```\n$ npm start\n```\n\nN\u00e3o havendo erros, ela abre na porta 3000. Portanto, visite: http://localhost:3000/ e\nfa\u00e7a sua primeira visita ao Jardim Zumbi.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n- **Pergunta**: Professor, por qu\u00ea n\u00e3o disponibilizar o c\u00f3digo com tudo\n  configuradinho de primeira? Voc\u00ea gosta de ver os alunos perdendo tempo?\n  - **Resposta**: objetivos pedag\u00f3gicos :scream:\n- **Pergunta**: Esse MySQL rid\u00edculo s\u00f3 tem linha de comando?? Cad\u00ea as\n  interfaces gr\u00e1ficas t\u00e3o prometidas??\n  - **Resposta**: [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)\n    :smirk:\n- **Pergunta**: Professor, a linguagem `['Java', 'C#', 'C'].pick()` me deixa\n  depurar meu programa para que eu veja direitinho o que est\u00e1 acontecendo,\n  passo a passo. Node.js \u00e9 um lixo!\n  - **Resposta**: [engana-se muito](#debugging), jovem Padawan\n- **Pergunta**: Estou no arquivo `routes/people.js` e criei uma rota\n  de `POST` para `/people`. Mas quando eu envio o formul\u00e1rio para cadastro de\n  nova pessoa, estou recebendo mensagem de erro 404 (rota inexistente).\n  Como faz?\n  - **Resposta rapidinha**: crie a rota para a URL `/` em vez de `/people`\n  - **Resposta bacana**: para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es mais grandinhas em Express.js, conv\u00e9m\n    deixar o c\u00f3digo da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o bem organizado e dividido em v\u00e1rios arquivos.\n    Neste caso do c\u00f3digo do Jardim Zumbi, as rotas est\u00e3o divididas entre os\n    arquivos da pasta `routes/` (`index.js`, `people.js` e `zombies.js`). Se\n    voc\u00ea abrir o arquivo na raiz do projeto `/app.js`, ver\u00e1:\n\n    ```js\n    import index from './routes/index.js'\n    import people from './routes/people.js'\n    import zombies from './routes/zombies.js'\n\n    // ...\n    app.use('/', index);          // rotas da p\u00e1gina inicial\n    app.use('/people', people);   // rotas das p\u00e1ginas que come\u00e7am com \"/people\"\n    app.use('/zombies', zombies); // rotas das p\u00e1ginas que come\u00e7am com \"/zombies\"\n    ```\n\n    Dentro de cada arquivo da pasta `routes`, estamos instanciando um\n    [`express.Router()`](http://expressjs.com/pt-br/guide/routing.html#express-router)\n    do Express.js que nos permite definir rotas para um certo prefixo\n    (e.g., `'/'`, `'/people'`, `'/zombies'` etc.).\n\n    Assim, uma rota definida pelo roteador que est\u00e1 em `routes/people.js` para\n    a URL `'/'`, est\u00e1, na verdade, sendo uma rota para a URL `'/people/'`.\n    Se for `'/new'`, \u00e9 na verdade `'/people/new'` e assim por diante.\n- **Pergunta**: Estou usando `req.params.XXX` para pegar o nome da pessoa que\n  deve ser cadastrada no banco, mas est\u00e1 vindo sempre `undefined`. Por qu\u00ea?\n  - **Resposta**: o nome da pessoa est\u00e1 sendo enviado por um formul\u00e1rio\n    via m\u00e9todo `POST` (para tudo que est\u00e1 fazendo e abra o arquivo\n    `views/new-person.hbs`).\n\n    Para recuperar algo enviado via `POST` no Express.js, voc\u00ea deve usar\n    [`req.body.XXX`](http://expressjs.com/pt-br/4x/api.html#req.body)\n    (o `req.params.XXX` recupera par\u00e2metros da rota, tipo\n    `/people/:id-da-pessoa`).\n- **Pergunta**: Mesmo lendo a resposta anterior, ainda n\u00e3o sei o que colocar no\n  `req.body.XXX`. O que \u00e9 esse `XXX`?\n  - **Resposta**: cada campo (`input`) do formul\u00e1rio sendo enviado (no caso,\n    o `form` em `views/new-person.hbs`) possui um atributo chamado `name` que\n    cont\u00e9m o nome do campo que ser\u00e1 recebido na rota. **N\u00e3o confunda o\n    atributo HTML `name` com o atributo `id`**: para formul\u00e1rios, o `id` n\u00e3o\n    tem nenhuma utilidade, mas o `name` sim.\n\n\n## _Debugging_\n\nSe quiser fazer _debugging_, precisamos passar um argumento de linha de comando\npara o Node e, depois, abrir o Chrome e usar as\n_dev tools_ e depurar o programa como se estivesse em um navegador.\n\n\nNa hora de iniciar a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, em vez de usar `npm start`, use:\n\n```\n$ node --inspect-brk bin/www.js\n```\n\nAbra o Chrome em qualquer aba/site, abra as ferramentas do desenvolvedor e clique no \u00edcone do Node.js que aparece no topo:\n\n![](docs/debugging.webp)\n\nIsso faz uma nova janela abrir com novas _dev tools_, mas apenas as funcionalidades relacionadas ao Node.js (eg, nada de DOM).\n\nDevido ao `--inspect-brk`, o Node coloca um _break-point_ na primeira linha do programa (`bin/www.js`). De l\u00e1, voc\u00ea pode colocar outros pontos de parada e depurar normalmente.\n\n"

If you just want to play the game, download the zip and the only file you need to extract is the `PwnAdventureZ.NES` \n\nIf you would like to play with the version of the ROM that contained the actual flags, you can either use the [PwnAdventureZ-csaw-withkeys.bin](https://github.com/Vector35/PwnAdventureZ/blob/master/PwnAdventureZ-csaw-withkeys.bin) by programming it on real hardware, or download the [PwnAdventureZ-csaw-withkeys.nes](https://github.com/Vector35/PwnAdventureZ/blob/master/PwnAdventureZ-csaw-withkeys.nes) rom file.\n\n## Difficulty\n\nPwnZ is not just for people looking to solve CTF challenges. It's also a fun game completely playable in its own right! The default easy mode is not meant as a challenge at all, but was intentionally easy to play so that it didn't impede the competition, but `HARD` and `APOCALYPSE` difficulty modes are much more challenge. To play in `HARD`, first enter your name as `QUEST 2.0` when starting a new game, and to play as `APOCALYPSE`, enter `UNBEARABLE` as your name. \n\n## Symbols\nIf you are working on the reverse engineering / vulnerability research challenges in the game, you'll be interested in the symbols included in the above `zip` file that allow debuggers like [FCEUX](http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html) and [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) (note that the open source verison does not support NES roms) to include names while analyzing the program. Simply unzip the original zip in the same place, and the symbols should automatically load. \n\n## Playing on Real Hardware\n\nIf you'd like to try the game on real hardware, we used components from [infiniteneslives.com](http://www.infiniteneslives.com/nessupplies.php). Specifically, you'll need to purchase an [INL Retro](http://www.infiniteneslives.com/kazzo.php) programmer, as well as a [Mapper 1 256kb with Save Battery](http://www.infiniteneslives.com/nessupplies.php#MMC1) rom.  \n\nAlternatively, fully assembled and programmed boards with art will be available from [infiniteneslives.com](http://www.infiniteneslives.com/) shortly. Keep an eye out\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Vector35/PwnAdventureZ/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for licensing information.\n\n"

Everytime a user saves a game, the game state is given an id, which is displayed as Game_ID along with the level on which the game was saved. 'Delete all progress' removes all the saved game states.\n- __Level Menu__ can be used for starting a new game from the unlocked levels. A user cannot play a new level if they haven't won the all previous levels.\n- __Exit Game__ saves all the progress and exits the game.\n- __In Game Menu__: Allows the user to save the game, restart the game or exit to main menu.\n- Levels become harder as the user progresses through the game. The cone and bucket zombies start appearing in subsequent levels, their frequency also increases. \n- Different menus on winning and losing a game. Winning tells the user about the new plant unlock and losing menu gives the message \u201cZombies ate your brains\u201d\n- After placing a plant, a plant is locked for sometime before it can be planted again.\n- The __shovel__ can be used to remove a plant from the lawn.\n- Sound effects have been added for all interactions on the lawn to enhance the experience.\n- The users can also choose between the day and the night mode. Unlike the day mode, no sun tokens fall from the sky in the night mode, and sunflowers are the only source of sun tokens.\n\n## Design Patterns\n1. Singleton: For the database and for shovel feature, as we need only one reference through out the game.\n2. Iterator - To ensure that Plant, Zombie and Lawnmower lists are accessed in a synchronized way.\n3. Facade for menu based implementation\n\n\n## Screenshots from the game\n![alt_text](https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies/blob/master/GameplayScreenshots/1.png)\n![alt_text](https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies/blob/master/GameplayScreenshots/4.png)\n![alt_text](https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies/blob/master/GameplayScreenshots/Arena.png)\n![alt_text](https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies/blob/master/GameplayScreenshots/2.png)\n![alt_text](https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies/blob/master/GameplayScreenshots/5.png)\n![alt_text](https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies/blob/master/GameplayScreenshots/3.png)\n\n## How To play\n### Executing the JAR File\nTo play the game, the following steps can be followed:\n1. Clone this repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/BhavyaC16/Plants-Vs-Zombies.git`\n2. cd into the directory `Plant-Vs-Zombies-JAR` using: `cd PlantsVsZombies/Plant-Vs-Zombies-JAR`\n3. Download the JavaFX SDK 11.0.2 from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), depending on your platform. Unzip and situate the folder `javafx-sdk-11.0.2` in `PlantsVsZombies/Plant-Vs-Zombies-JAR`\n4. Execute the command `./PlantsVsZombies.sh` . Alternatively, execute the command `java --module-path ~/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.media -jar PlantVsZombies.jar`<br>\n(Note: `--module-path` specifies the path to your JavaFX SDK 11 lib folder. The variable `LIB_PATH` in `PlantsVsZombies` holds the path to the lib folder, and can be updated accordingly.)\n\n## Code and assets\nPath to code: `PlantVsZombies/src/sample` <br>\nPath to Images and sounds: `PlantVsZombies/src/sample/assets`\n\n## License\n### GNU General Public License v3.0\nYou may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files.

If you didn't, you can't start game. You just stuck in login interface.\n\n\n## How to run\n1. You need public [score server](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defense-fps-multiplayer-score-server) and it must be run before game starts.\n2. You need Photon's AppID and ChatAppID. Put in them to \"/Assets/Photon Unity Networking/Resources/PhotonServerSettings\".\n3. Select your closest region. It's just recommendation. I live in South Korea, so I used \"Kr\" region.\n4. Change URL that Http requests.\n5. Run!\n\n\n## Control - Alive\n- WASD: Basic movements\n- R: Reloading\n- M1: Fire\n- M2: Aiming\n- L-Shift: Sprinting\n- T: Using chat\n\n\n## Control - Inspector\n- WASD: Movements\n- Space: Floating up\n- Ctrl: Floating down\n\n\n## Rules\n- You will spawn with Police 9mm pistol.\n- After 15 seconds that game began, Zombies will spawn some spots.\n- Kill the zombies to gain experience and cash.\n- Upgrade your weapons or buy new gun with that cash.\n- It's endless survival game. Zombies will getting stronger and stronger, also gives more funds and exps.\n\n\n## Weapons\n- Police 9mm: Police 9mm is standard police sidearm. It has 15 ammo capacity, low recoil, fast reload speed with cheapest upgrade/ammunition cost.\n- Compakt PDW: Compakt PDW is cheapest primary weapon in this game. It has 25 ammo capacity with lowest damage per bullet, but also has fastest fire rate in this game.\n- Portable Magnum: Portable Magnum is a powerful sidearm that can kill zombies with single headshot with proper damage upgrade. But becareful, it's ammunition is expensive and don't gives much ammo to use. Aim the head!\n- Auto 45: Auto 45 is a primary submachinegun that fires .45 ACP calibers. It's little bit slower than Compakt PDW, but it has much higher damage to kill zombies within 3~4 headshots with proper damage upgrade.\n- Defender Shotgun: Defender Shotgun has most powerful damage with close distance, with single shot. It fires 8 pellets per single shot, and these bullets will penetrate enemy if it's dead. But it has slowest fire rate of this game, and also reloading speed is slow. Don't forget to make distance to kill zombies at one shot, but not gonna hit by them.\n- Stov Rifle: Stov Rifle has highest DPS in this Game. It's military assault rifle that fires 7.62mm catridge with full-automatic. It has really high recoil and has slow reload speed, but it has magnificent fire power. You can kill the zombies with 2~3 headshots with proper damage upgrade.\n\n\n## Upgrades\n- Damage Boost: Increases damager per bullet\n- Faster Reload: Increases reloading speed\n- Reduce Recoil: Reduces gun's recoil on fire\n- Extend Mag: Extend magazine's ammo capacity\n- Max Ammo: Extend max ammo can hold\n- More Health: Extend max health, also gives 20 hp immediately right after purchased.\n- Regeneration: Activate health regeneration\n\n\n## Other purchasables\n- Ammunition: Refill your current weapon's ammunition.

Respawned player has immune for all attacks in 15 seconds. Also some of fund before player dies will restored(70% total fund will refunded, also every upgrade costs also)\n\n\n## Bugs & Improvements\nPlease write the issue on the github page when you found bugs. But I have no plan to improve this game, because this game is just for demonstration.\n\n\n## See Also\n- [Score Server](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defense-fps-multiplayer-score-server)\n- [Web Scoreboard](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defense-fps-multiplayer-scoreboard)\n\n\n## Donate me\nAll my tutorials and projects are made for help people who want to learn.

  "readme_contents": "# Zombie\nThis is Zombie! An app that never dies, and keeps coming for your release files. It allows you to synch files from GitHub Releases directly to specified locations on the user drive. It runs continously in the background making sure that you are always up to date with your latest GitHub Release. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"/_graphics/PNG/iconsZombie.png\">\n</p>\n\n## What is Zombie?\n\nZombie is a small app that keeps your plug-ins up to date. It communicates with a GitHub repository, scanning it's Releases for any changes. If there was an update to the Release on GitHub, Zombie will download it and distribute on your computer per defined settings. It has two components: \n\n1. Zombie Service.\n2. Zombie GUI.\n\n#### 1. Zombie Service\n\nThis part of Zombie runs in the background as a [Windows Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications). The reason it's a Windows Service is simple: we needed it to be a System level application with admin privelages. Since the main job that this service does, is to move files around on a computer we needed it to have admin rights in case that we need to copy some files into ProgramData, ProgramFiles etc. \n\nZombieService also hosts a [WCF (Windows Commmunications Foundation)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/whats-wcf) Service inside of it. What is that? It's a server. What for? Well, Windows Service cannot have a GUI component to it, so we needed to de-couple the GUI from the Service. Now that they are seperate and actually two (2) seperate processes, we needed a way to communicate between them, in case that you wanted to ask the Service to do something (perform an update etc.). \n\n#### 2. Zombie GUI\n\nThis part of Zombie is a WPF App that allows us to create, and set settings for the Zombie Service. Like I said, Windows Service doesn't have a GUI so this is a stand-alone app, that uses a WCF framework to talk to the service. It uses port 8000 to do the talking. \n\n## How does Zombie work: \n\n1. Publish GitHub Release: [How to create a Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)\n2. Get Access Token for that Repository: [How to create a Personal Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)\n3. Setup Zombie GitHub Connection: \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/_info/githubsettings.png\">\n</p>\n\n4. Setup Zombie File Mappings:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/_info/fileMappings.png\">\n</p>\n\n5.

  "readme_contents": "# Community-Game\nThis game is the second series of the community games by Matthew Hopson's Discord Community.\nThis time around, we're replicating a Zombie game that we found online.\n\n# How to join us\n\nJust join our public discord, where all of the development happens. For project related talk just look under the \"Community Project\" category.\n\n`https://discord.gg/feKbBwS`\n\n# Building and Contributing\n\nIf you want to know how to contribute to this project,\nlook at [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). The document will tell you how you can get the project\nfiles with git, and how to contribute your code back into this\nmain repository.\n\nThere is also an easier way using the renewed desktop app \"Github for Desktop\", but this is not yet documented by anyone. \nYou can follow the command instructions in the GUI app, however, as the backend to the GUI app is the Git command line. Therefor,\nthe Github GUII app will have all the same features and buttons as Git (but git has them command-wise.)\n\nAlso take a look at the [`CODESTYLE.md`](CODESTYLE.md) file. \nThis file makes it clear which coding-format is acceptable in this repository.\nPull Requests not conforming to the coding standard will be rejected. \nA rejected pull request can be re-opened when the code has been changed and is conforming.\n\n# Compiling the project\n\nFirst, download the repository to your local machine.\n\n`git clone --recursive https://github.com/HopsonCommunity/ZombieGame`\n\n## Preparation\n\n#### Linux\nAs SFML will be built from sources, you will be required to have the SFML sources.\n##### Debian-based(eg. Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu, ...)\n``sudo apt-get install -y libpthread-stubs0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libfreetype6-dev libglew1.5-dev libjpeg8-dev libsndfile1-dev libopenal-dev libudev-dev libxcb-image0-dev libjpeg-dev libflac-dev``\nThe -y parameter works by automatically accepting the requests for approval.\n\n##### Arch Linux-based(eg. Manjaro)\n``sudo pacman -S libpthread-stubs libx11 libxrandr libjpeg libsndfile libudev0 libxcb mesa libxrandr freetype2 glew libjpeg-turbo openal flac``\n\n\nOther distributions will follow. The dependency names are listed here:\nhttps://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/compile-with-cmake.php\n\n## Compiling with Visual Studio\nIn Visual Studio, click on ``File->Open->Folder`` and select the root project folder.\nVisual Studio should detect the CMakeLists.txt file. It prints the CMake log into\nthe console. It should look like this:\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WPpcCj7.png\" />\n:::If there are any errors, please check that you have copied over the dependencies to the right folder.:::\nNext, click on the Dropdown arrow at the Launch-Button and select the game.\nThe project will now be compiled and executed.\n\n## Compiling in CLion\nGo to ``FILE->Import Project`` and select the root project folder.\n\nSelect ``Open Project`` and wait for CLion to prepare the IDE.\n\nClick the green play button and in the executable config select the only available.\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gwbZoA5.png\" />\n\nThe IDE reads the CMakeLists.txt and compiles the program.\n\n## Compiling without an IDE\n#### Preparation Windows\nMake sure you have MINGW with a c++ compiler, make installed in your path.\nInstall CMake from the official website and add it to the PATH.\n\n**Note:** For the game to be correctly executed on Windows you will need to install OpenAL, check OpenAL at https://openal.org/downloads/ and download the latest installer.\n\n#### Linux\nInstall a C++ compiler, make and CMake using your distribution's package manager.\n\n#### Mac is currently not supported as it is untested\n\n#### Compiling\nGo into the cloned repository and make a folder called `build`\n\n`mkdir build`\n\nThen, run CMake inside that build folder pointing the root folder.\n\n`cd build`\n`cmake ..`\n\nCMake creates the Makefile in the build directory. Now you can just run\n\n`make`\n\nand your files will be compiled.\n\n## Program crashes when launching?\n\nIn most cases, crashes will be caused by the lack of the \"res/\" folder where the\nexecutable files lie. Just copy the folder to your \"build/\" folder and this will\nmost likely get you up and running again.\n\nIf you're unable to resolve your errors, feel free to contact us on Discord!\n\n### HAVE FUN CODING!\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Introduction\n---------------\nPlants vs Zombies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies) is a tower-defense and strategy game which involves an army of zombies trying to enter the house(lawn) and eat your brains. The only way you can stop them is by using your arsenal of plants that will zap the zombies at your command. The plants - Pea-shooters, Beetroots, Walnuts, and Sunflowers - are all set to destroy the zombies who dare to enter your backyard.\n\n# Guide\n--------\nThe playing field is divided into 5 horizontal lanes, a zombie will only move towards the player's house along one lane . Planting costs \"sun\" (sun acts as the currency for the game, required for buying plants), which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) and also by planting the sunflower plant which generates a sun at regular intervals. Plants can only attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in.\n\nIn our implementation we have provided the users with 4 plants:\n\n* PeaShooter - Peashooter is the first and the primary attacking plant the game. It is a peashooting plant that shoots peas on seeing a zombie. It costs 100 suns.\n* BeetRoot - The users have another attacking plant , the BeetRoot which shoots beets insteasd of peas which are faster and hence is priced a bit higher at 125 suns.\n* SunFlower - Sunflower is an essential sun-producing plant which is necessary for producing suns - the currency of the game. It costs 50 suns. Each sun produced from sunflower adds 25 units to your sun counter.\n* Walnut - Walnut is the defensive plant that acts as a shield for the player's plants. It takes a long time for zombies to eat it, providing an effective cover for the plants located behind it. It is mainly used to stall zombies to waste their time, letting other plants attack them.\n\nIn this mini-version we implemented only 2 zombies:\n\n* Normal Zombie - Normal zombies and their time-themed variants in Plants vs. Zombies 2 are the most basic \"zombie\" units. In fact, it takes four shots for a pea plant to kill them. Having no special defensive equipment or travel abilities, these zombies are susceptible to any type of attack.\n* Football Zombie - It's a tough zombie and it takes the PeaShooter 5 shots to kill it.\n\n\n# Developers\n----------\n* Rohan Goel (rohangoel96)\n* Pulkit Agarwal (thepulkitagarwal)\n\n\n*Download and play the game (13MB) : http://bit.ly/java-PvZ* <br>\n*Watch the demonstration video at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqmCRmsnW9U*\n"

The red highlighted tiles in the map are the only places roads should leave the map.\n\nThere used to be a way to place full buildings, complete with defined walls and entrances (Building Archetypes) but that seems broken.\n\n### Branches\n\nThe \"master\" branch is what's currently hosted on http://www.deadvalleygame.com\n\nThe \"standalone\" branch has the most up to date code -- all of the Sprite and Inventory classes have had their view and data centered code split to make future development easier.\n\n### Tests\n\nThere's a suite of Jasmine tests in the *test/* directory that put some aspects of the game through their paces. The coverage is spotty and the test code is kind of ratty but at least it exists.\n\nDrag this to your browser bar: <a href=\"javascript:$.getScript('test/runner.js');\">Test Runner Bookmarklet</a>\n\nReload the game then click on the bookmarklet to run the tests.\n\nLicense\n-------\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">Dead Valley</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://dougmcinnes.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Doug McInnes</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# nZombies Unlimited\nnZombies Unlimited is an experimental idea of breaking the [original nZombies](https://github.com/Zet0rz/nzombies) free from its limits. It is a complete recreation built from the ground up with the idea of modularizing _everything_ and supporting full toolkits for Config creation.\n\n**Status:** Early development (not playable)\n\n**How to follow progress:** View progress in the [Projects tab](https://github.com/Zet0rz/nZombies-Unlimited/projects). Read about each entry by clicking it.\n\n**How to have an influence:** Comment on the Issues shown in the current Project with suggestions around that part.\n\n## What's different?\nnZombies Unlimited bases itself on a series of ideas:\n- Sandbox-based Config Creation\n- Logic System\n- Powerful, rich Config structure\n- Modularized Extension system\n\n### Unlimited Creation\nUsing Sandbox for creating Configs breaks nZombies free from its prior Creative Mode limits. It will work with _everything_. Ropes, ragdolls, custom entities, _anything_. Any and all tools will also be available (though some less useful in an nZombies context), and most of the known nZombies Tools will appear here as well. Config Saves will be based on the same system Garry's Mod uses to save entire Sandbox games; That means _everything_ will be saved. There will be no limits.\n\n### Powerful Logic System\nInteract with the Logic Map which shows a top-down view of all Logic-enabled entities in the map. Connect them to Logic units to created complicated and interesting mechanics. Want a limited-time Pack-a-Punch room? Hook up a Button Logic unit to a door, and connect that to a Timer which will trigger a Zone to teleport all players in it to a specific location. Want buildables? Hook up a Randomizer to a series of Item Spawners that spawn parts of your buildable. Even hook up a Soul Collector to a Game Win unit for full game-ending Easter Eggs! Even control the spawners themselves!\n\n### Rich Config Structure\nLike mentioned, Configs will save _everything_ in the world. However it will also save metadata, such as a custom thumbnail, name, description, and list of authors. It will even be able to detect installed Workshop addons and let you checkmark those used for the Config, prompting the player loading it to install those if not already. Configs will be easy to move into an Addon folder and uploaded to the Workshop.\n\n### Modularized Extension System\nAddons can take the form of Extensions, letting the game detect and load them as the users enables them in their Configs. They will only load when Configs specify them, or when otherwise manually enabled by an Admin as a Config Override. Extensions can do anything the main gamemode does: Add new perks, powerups, logic units, or even entire new systems like the Perk system itself. Almost all visuals can be added to, including HUD Packs and Zombie Model packs. Extensions can also add new Zombies and Bosses. All while giving the power to the user; Extensions are only loaded when the Config enables it in its settings.\n\n## What else?\nOther than these core ideas, the whole gamemode will be built up from scratch. New lobby screen/menu, new modularized systems, new and more robust Zombie NPCs. All Zombie Models come with Animation-only rigs allowing you to compile any Valve-based model into one with all necessary animations using $includemodel. Overall, this will be the definitive nZombies. The one that breaks free from all the limits.\n"

This can be used by the living for either concealment or bartering and the living impaired will have an easier time asking for brains. \n\nThe translator can be done as a series of regular expressions (Links to an external site.) or you can step through it character by character. You get a string and you transform that string. \n\n## The Rules\n\nThere are some sample rules contained in the skeleton source code and are as follows:\n\nlower-case \"r\" at the end of words replaced with \"rh\".\nan \"a\" or \"A\" is replaced with \"hra\". *Edited to be easier.* \nthe starts of sentences are capitalized (the \"start of a sentence\" is any occurrence of \".!?\", followed by a space, followed by a letter.)\n\"e\" or \"E\" is replaced by \"rr\"\n\"i\" or \"I\" is replaced by \"rrRr\"\n\"o\" or \"O\" is replaced by \"rrrRr\"\n\"u\" or \"U\" is replaced by \"rrrrRr\"\n\"r\" or \"R\" is replaced by \"RR\"\n \n\nThere should be 10 rules total. So make 2 rules up. ~~Each rule should be a separate function.~~ *Edited out. Unnecessary*\n\nMake use of 3 different jasmine \"expect\" methods per rule. http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html (Links to an external site.) Zombies are known to be able to repeat the same statements over and over. We want to make sure the rules are not written by the undead and aren't just a list of expect(myFunc('i')).toBe('rrRr');\n\nFor example:\n```\nexpect(30).toBe(30);\nexpect(undefinedVariable).toBeUndefined();\nexpect('30').toContain('0');\nexpect(callback).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith(jasmine.stringMatching(/^bar$/));\n```\n \n\nWhat really matters is the structure. The last thing the resistance needs is for zombies to write false translators to trick us. We need to make sure a human, professional developer created the zombie translator. We all know zombies don't know how to write modular code, and they never test. \n\nEach of the rules needs to be modular enough to test separately. There should also be a test for the entire function. \n\n### Rules Shouldn't Overlap\n\nRunning most of these rules is going to produce some \"r\"s. You shouldn't be running any of the \"r\" rules on the r's that are produced from other rules. Yes, that sounds confusing. Here's some examples to help you out. Maybe you could write some tests with these?\n```\nTerror -> TrrRRRRrrrRrrh \n\nJaZahn -> JhraZhrahn\n\npetty -> prrtty\n\npretty -> pRRrrtty\n\nbrains -> bRRhrarrRrns\n\nonomatopoeia  -> rrrRrnrrrRrmhratrrrRrprrrRrrrrrRrhra\n```\n\n## Starting point\nYou can use this repository for a starting point: https://github.com/CSCI-E32/zombietranslator (Links to an external site.) \n\n## Submission\nZip up the project when you're done and submit the zip file. \n\n## Have to use\nYou have to use RequireJS and Jasmine and Karma. \n\nTests need to be run with Karma. Jasmine Tests. On RequireJS modules.\n\n## Extra credit \n*20pts*\nIf you correctly \"unzombify\" (with tests).\n\n*NOTE: not everything will unzombify perfectly. That's okay.

  "readme_contents": "Zombie Phantom\n-----------------------\n\nThis is a Node.js package that provides a Zombie.js shim around the PhantomJS headless\nbrowser.  The motivation behind this package is that when looking for a headless\nbrowser solution, I really liked the API of Zombie.js as well as the full Node.js\nsupport behind it, however it is not a full WebKit browser.  PhantomJS on the other\nhand is a better technology in terms of headless browser, but does not have a\nnative Node.js integration.  The <a href=\"https://github.com/alexscheelmeyer/node-phantom\">Node Phantom</a>\npackage integrates the PhantomJS into the Node.js framework, but what it doesn't\ndo, and likely so, is provide a better API like the Zombie.js framework.\n\nThis package simply attempts to act as a drop-in replacement for Zombie.js but\nusing the PhantomJS headless browser.\n\n<strong>NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS STILL INCOMPLETE AND IS NOT A FULL DROP-IN REPLACEMENT\nFOR ZOMBIE.JS</strong>\n\nInstallation\n========================\n\nStep 1\n============\nInstall node.js by going to http://nodejs.org\n\nStep 2\n============\nInstall PhantomJS by going to http://phantomjs.org/download.html\n\nStep 3\n============\nInstall this package using Node Package Manager (npm)\n\n```\nnpm install zombie-phantom\n```\n\nDifferences between Zombie.js\n=========================\nUsing this library is going to be 'similar' to using Zombie.js.  I couldn't make\nit an exact replica of Zombie.js due to the nature of the asynchronous behavior\nof interacting with any API within PhantomJS.  For example, to get the text of\nan element on the page looks like the following in both Zombie.js and this module.\n\n<strong>Zombie.js</strong>\n```\nvar Browser = require('zombie');\nvar browser = new Browser({\n  site: 'http://localhost:8888'\n});\n\nbrowser.visit('/user/login', function() {\n  var text = browser.text('h1');\n  console.log(text);\n});\n```\n\nWhereas in Zombie-Phantom, everything is asynchronous... like so.\n\n<strong>Zombie-Phantom</strong>\n```\nvar Browser = require('zombie-phantom');\nvar browser = new Browser({\n  site: 'http://localhost:8888'\n});\n\nbrowser.visit('/user/login', function() {\n  browser.text('h1', function(text) {\n    console.log(text);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nUsing query, queryAll, and xpath\n=================================\nAnother big difference is that this library does not return actual DOM elements\nwhich you can use to manipulate.  It does however, return an index into a DOM\narray within the PhantomJS browser which you can use to perform the same actions\nas you would with Zombie.js.  It is easier to think of this index as a DOM element\nID which you return back to the library to do stuff... Here is an example.\n\n```\nvar _ = require('underscore');\nvar async = require('async');\nvar Browser = require('zombie');\nvar browser = new Browser({\n  site: 'http://localhost:8888'\n});\n\nbrowser.visit('/user/login', function() {\n  browser.query('h1.title', function(title) {\n\n    // title is actually an ID to a DOM element here, not an actual element.\n    // But, I can still pass it along to the browser API like I would and it\n    // will still work by referencing the DOM element within PhantomJS.\n    browser.xpath('..//label', title, function(labels) {\n\n      // labels is actually just an array of ID's here, but I can still use them\n      _.each(labels, function(label) {\n        drupal.browser.text(label, function(text) {\n          console.log(text);\n        });\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nPromises using Async.js\n==========================\nAs you can tell, the promise system from Zombie.js has not been implemented,\nhowever, you can replicate this functionality using the <a href=\"https://github.com/caolan/async\">Async.js</a>\nlibrary.  Here is an example of using the promises from async to turn what\nwas once callback hell into an easy to follow series of executions.\n\n<strong>example.js</strong>\n```\nvar Browser = require('zombie-phantom');\nvar async = require('async');\n\nvar browser = new Browser({\n  site: 'http://localhost:8888'\n});\n\n// Current this library does not support promises, but you can use async.series\n// to get something similar...\n\nasync.series([\n  function(done) { browser.visit('/user/login', done); },\n  function(done) { browser.fill('#user-name', 'admin', done); },\n  function(done) { browser.fill('#user-pass', '123password', done); },\n  function(done) { browser.pressButton('#edit-submit', done); },\n  function(done) { browser.visit('/node/add/article', done); },\n  function(done) { browser.fill('#edit-title', 'This is a test!', done); },\n  function(done) { browser.pressButton('#edit-submit', done) }\n], function() {\n  console.log('Content Created!');\n  browser.close();\n});\n\n```\nPlease contribute to make this project better.\n"

You are welcome to try it out and provide any feedback in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/laughedelic/atom-ide-scala) or [Github issues](https://github.com/laughedelic/atom-ide-scala/issues).\n\nThis plugin is written in **[Scala.js]**, so if you are a Scala developer looking for better development experience in Atom, you're encouraged to contribute. Check the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [open issues](https://github.com/laughedelic/atom-ide-scala/issues) especially the ones marked with `help wanted` label.\n\nThe work of this plugin is to launch the language server and wire communication with it to the Atom IDE services. Most of the interesting stuff is happening on the server side, so check also the [scalameta/metals](https://github.com/scalameta/metals) project.\n\nDuring development some reusable parts were split into separate repos:\n\n* [scalajs-atom-api](https://github.com/laughedelic/scalajs-atom-api): Scala.js facades for Atom-related APIs (including atom-languageclient)\n* [sbt-atom-package](https://github.com/laughedelic/sbt-atom-package): an sbt plugin wraping apm and simplifying development of Scala.js-based Atom plugins\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, you need to install [language-scala](https://github.com/atom-community/language-scala) for basic Scala syntax highlighting. Then you can open the [package page](https://atom.io/packages/ide-scala) and click the green _Install_ button.\n\nOr you can run this command:\n\n```\napm install language-scala ide-scala\n```\n\nOn the first launch it will automatically install its dependencies if needed:\n+ [atom-ide-ui](https://github.com/facebook-atom/atom-ide-ui) for the Atom IDE interface\n\n## Usage\n\nThis plugin can work with different Scala language servers: Metals for Scala 2 projects or Dotty for Scala 3 projects. The plugin tries to determine which server to launch depending on the project setup.\n\nPlugin gets activated only when you open a `.scala` file.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Notice that when you close all tabs with Scala files, language server will be stopped. See [atom-languageclient#141](https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient/issues/141) for discussion on this behavior.\n\n### [Metals]\n\nMetals project setup is completely automatic: when you open a new project, it will ask you if you want to import the build definition. If something goes wrong or doesn't work as expected, run Metals Doctor through the command palette.\n\nMore details on the [Metals website](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/atom.html).\n\n### [Dotty]\n\nSetup a [Dotty sbt project](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project) and run `sbt configureIDE` in it, then just open the project in Atom.\n\nOfficial instructions may tell you to run `launchIDE` in sbt, but this command can only launch VS Code, so just use `configureIDE` instead and open the project in Atom.\n\n### [Ensime]\n\n\ud83d\udea7 Ensime support is removed for now because the LSP implementation of the Ensime server is quite unstable at the moment and Ensime is not actively maintained. So even if the client works well, the server might be broken and you won't see any features working. \ud83d\udea7\n\nFollow [ensime-server#1951](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/pull/1951) for more information and _get involved if you want to use Ensime LSP server_.\n\n\n[Scala]: http://scala-lang.org/\n[Scala.js]: https://www.scala-js.org/\n[Atom IDE]: https://ide.atom.io/\n[Metals]: https://github.com/scalameta/metals\n[LSP]: https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol\n[Dotty]: http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/ide-support.html\n[Ensime]: http://ensime.github.io/\n"

  "readme_contents": "# crypto-kitties\nA Crypto Kitties clone. For fun... and maybe food for the Crypto Zombies tutorial! Mwuahahah!\n\nHosted on Netlify: https://mayjer-academy-kitties.netlify.app/\n\nOriginal project, check them out!<br>\nhttps://www.cryptokitties.co/\n\n### Contracts\nDeployed on Ropsten\n\nKitties: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xd4bcc3f1c483ea10fdb97523357ca660e6b3c71e\n\nMarketplace: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xa67e70910341ddf96537f005280a4417b5b29578\n\n### Tech Stack\n\nContracts: solidity, truffle, ganache\n\nFront End: react, redux, html, CSS, javascript, react-bootstrap, styled-components, redux-sagas\n\nTesting: mocha, chai, truffle-assertions\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Requires an Etherem wallet like <a href=\"https://metamask.io/\" target=\"_blank\">MetaMask</a>\n\n2. You'll need some test ETH on the Ropsten network. Visit a <a href=\"https://faucet.dimensions.network/\" target=\"_blank\">faucet</a> to get some free test ETH. Make sure you've set your wallet network to `Ropsten`.\n\n3. Visit the <a href=\"https://mayjer-academy-kitties.netlify.app/\" target=\"_blank\">Academy Kitties</a> website.\n\n4. Make sure your wallet is on the `Ropsten` test network. Press the \"Connect\" button. This will connect the wallet to the app so it can query the blockchain for your kitties.\n\n5. Head over to the Marketplace to get some kitties! Once you have 2 kitties you can breed them and have kittens.\n\n### Academy Kitties DNA\n\nThe DNA structure is a 16 digit number with the following breakdown. The Kitten DNA is a random combination of the parent DNA with a chance for a completely random value.\n\n| DNA Digits | Cattribute | Values |\n|---|---|---|\n|00-01 | Body Color | 10-99 |\n|02-03 | Accent Color | 10-99 |\n|04-05 | Eye Color | 10-99 |\n|06-07 | Ear Color | 10-99 |\n| 08 | Eye Shape | 0-7 |\n| 09 | Pattern | 0-3 |\n| 10-11 | Pattern Color|  10-99 |\n| 12-13 | Pattern Accent Color | 10-99 |\n| 14 | Animation | 0-4 |\n| 15 | Mysterious | 0-7 |\n\n### Cooldown\n\nWhen parent kitties breed they need time to rest before breeding again. Breed cooldowns are defined below.\n\nhttps://guide.cryptokitties.co/guide/cat-features/cooldown-speed\n\n| Generation  | Cooldown Name  | Cooldown Time  |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0, 1 | fast  | 1 minute  |\n| 2, 3 | swift | 2 minutes |\n| 4, 5 | swift | 5 minutes |\n| 6, 7 | snappy | 10 minutes |\n| 8, 9 | snappy | 30 minutes |\n| 10, 11 | brisk | 1 hour |\n| 12, 13 | brisk | 2 hours |\n| 14, 15 | plodding | 4 hours |\n| 16, 17 | plodding | 8 hours |\n| 18, 19 | slow | 16 hours |\n| 20, 21 | slow | 24 hours |\n| 22, 23 | sluggish | 2 days |\n| 24, 25 | sluggish | 4 days |\n| 26+ | catatonic | 1 week |\n\n## Running the project locally\n\n1. Have node `12.x` installed\n2. Install the Truffle suite globally via `npm install -g truffle`\n3. `npm install` to install the project dependencies\n4. You'll need a local ETH blockchain like Ganache. Can use either the <a href=\"https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache\" target=\"_blank\">graphical interface</a> or the CLI (`npm install -g ganache-cli`). If using the graphical app create a new workspace and link the truffle config file `/truffle-config.js` to the workspace.\n5. Deploy the contracts\n   1. `truffle console`\n   2. `migrate`\n6. Copy the `KittyContract` and `KittyMarketPlace` contract deployed addresses into `/src/components/js/service.js` into the `static chainIdToAddress` variable with ID `0x539` (this is the chain ID for Ganache)\n7. Run the app with `npm start` and open a browser to `http://localhost:3000`\n\n## Deploy to Test Net\n\nDeploying the project contracts to a test net requires a `.env` config file which expects the following entries. You can get a free Infura API key by creating an account at their website <a href=\"https://infura.io/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n```\n# 12 word seed phrase for the test net HD wallet provider\nMNEMONIC=\n\n# Infura project ID for the hosted ETH node\nINFURA_PROJECT_ID=\n```\n\nFollow the local deployment instructions above except use `truffle console --network ropsten` (or your test network of choice).\n\n#### Bootcamp project template\nhttps://github.com/Ivan-on-Tech-Academy/academy-kitties-template/tree/master\n"

A simple graphical style allows for a focus on gameplay. The game is very customisable with full modding support. There are a variety of game types, with scripting done in Lua. Multiple view modes - top down, behind player and first-person - allow for a unique perspective of the action. Dynamic and scriptable weather and day/night effects create a dynamic environment. The gameplay is rounded out by a number of interesting vehicles including tanks, utes, and trains.

Cool! How fun would it be to take over drones, carrying Amazon packages\u2026or take over any other drones, and make them my little zombie drones. Awesome.\n\nUsing a Parrot AR.Drone 2, a Raspberry Pi, a USB battery, an Alfa AWUS036H wireless transmitter, aircrack-ng, node-ar-drone, node.js, and my SkyJack software, I developed a drone that flies around, seeks the wireless signal of any other drone in the area, forcefully disconnects the wireless connection of the true owner of the target drone, then authenticates with the target drone pretending to be its owner, then feeds commands to it and all other possessed zombie drones at my will.\n\nSkyJack also works when grounded as well, no drone is necessary on your end for it to work. You can simply run it from your own Linux machine/Raspberry Pi/laptop/etc and jack drones straight out of the sky.\n\n![http://samy.pl/skyjack/drone-pwn.png](http://samy.pl/skyjack/drone-pwn-small.png)\n\n------\n\n## Download\nYou can acquire SkyJack from github: <https://github.com/samyk/skyjack>\n\n\n\n### Software\n\n#### SkyJack\n[SkyJack](http://samy.pl/skyjack) (available from github) is primarily a perl application which runs off of a Linux machine, runs aircrack-ng in order to get its wifi card into monitor mode, detects all wireless networks and clients around, deactivates any clients connected to Parrot AR.drones, connects to the now free Parrot AR.Drone as its owner, then uses node.js with node-ar-drone to control zombie drones.\n\nI detect drones by seeking out any wireless connections from MAC addresses owned by the Parrot company, which you can find defined in the [Registration Authority OUI](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt).\n\n#### aircrack-ng\n\nI use [aircrack-ng](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/) to put our wireless device into monitor mode to find our drones and drone owners. I then use aireplay-ng to [deauthenticate](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=deauthentication) the true owner of the drone I'm targeting. Once deauthenticated, I can connect as the drone is waiting for its owner to reconnect.\n\n#### node-ar-drone\nI use [node-ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone) to control the newly enslaved drone via Javascript and [node.js](http://nodejs.org).\n\n\n### Hardware\n\n#### Parrot AR.Drone 2\nThe [Parrot AR.Drone 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HZLLOK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007HZLLOK&linkCode=as2&tag=samypl0c-20) is the drone that flies around seeking other drones, controlled from an iPhone, iPad or Android, and is also the type of drone SkyJack seeks out in order to control. SkyJack is also capable of seeking out Parrot AR.Drone version 1.\n\nThe Parrots actually launch their own wireless network which is how the owner of the drone connects. We take over by deauthenticating the owner, then connecting now that the drone is waiting for its owner to connect back in, exploiting the fact that we destroyed their wireless connection temporarily.\n\n#### Raspberry Pi\nI use a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQQF9C/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B009SQQF9C&linkCode=as2&tag=samypl0c-20) to drive the project as it's inexpensive, reasonably light, has USB, and runs Linux.\n\n#### Alfa AWUS036H wireless adapter\n\nI use the [Alfa AWUS036H](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QYGNKQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000QYGNKQ&linkCode=as2&tag=samypl0c-20) wireless card which supports raw packet injection and monitor mode which allow me to deauthenticate users who are legitimately connected to their drones.\n\n#### Edimax EW-7811Un wireless adapter\n\nI also use the [Edimax EW-7811Un](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MTTJOY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003MTTJOY&linkCode=as2&tag=samypl0c-20) wireless USB adapter in order for SkyJack to launch its own network. This allows me to connect to SkyJack from my laptop or iPad and watch all the other drones as they're being controlled.\n\n#### USB Battery\n\nI suggest any [USB battery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IHV326/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003IHV326&linkCode=as2&tag=samypl0c-20) which is light (under 100 grams), and can output close to an amp (1000mAh). The Raspberry Pi + wifi will likely use about this much juice. You could also possibly hook up three AAA batteries together to get about 4.5V out which would be a bit lighter, though I'm not sure how much current it will be able to output.\n\n\n## Questions?\n\nFeel free to contact me with any questions!\n\nYou can reach me at <code@samy.pl>.\n\nFollow [@SamyKamkar](https://twitter.com/samykamkar) on Twitter or check out <http://samy.pl> for my other projects.\n"

With firefox you can debug while running the tests with firebug!\n\nand then call\n\n    ./run-unit-specs.sh\n\nThere's also a neat way to run all specs:\n\n    ./run-all-specs.sh\n\njQuery.ajax is faked during the unit tests using [jasmine-fake-ajax](https://github.com/mileskin/jasmine-fake-ajax)\n\n## Launching the application\n\nIf you are interested in manually fiddling with the application (not much to see though), you may start the server by calling\n\n    cd ./application && node ./foo-twitter-client.js --port=8082\n\nScripts\n\n    ./start-application.sh\n    ./stop-application.sh\n\nare using port 8003 and are ment to be used by the specs only. This enables keeping the application running in isolation from the specs.\n\n## TODO\n\n* Some more application features\n* css using [Less.js](http://fadeyev.net/2010/06/19/lessjs-will-obsolete-css/) or [Stylus](http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/3167096936/stylus-0-4-0-released)\n\nHope you enjoy, don't forget to [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/mileskin)!\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "[ ] Fix gameplay on ipad\n\n[ ] The buildings still disappear when the zombies break in.\n\n[ ] No people are spawned when the zombies breaks into the buildings on the right.\n\n[x] The smoke does not seem to work on the chimneys.\n\n[ ] There are no armed townspeople to fight back after zombies raid a house. \n\n[ ] We need  three buttons on the GUI in the lower left corner that spawns zombies in the graveyard, werewolves in a patch of forest and minotaurs from offscreen (cave?).\n\n[ ] A new GUI \"health\" bar that indicates mana needed to spawn monsters.\n\n[ ] The characters are not moving, so is there a way to get them running around and attacking one another? And maybe turn on the afraid running away animations and yellow glow so there is a lot of activity... \n\n[ ] And is it possible to make the knights and monsters converge on the town and start attacking one another. That would look great. \n\n[ ] There are flat grey rectangles sticking out of the roof of two of the houses. I am not sure what that is or if it should be deleted.\n\n[ ] The lightening strikes the edges of the graveyard and some zombies are spawned outside the walls of the graveyard.  Can this be changed so that it all happens closer to the center of the graveyard.  And can someone tie the lightening SFX directly to the lightening strikes?\n\n[ ] Can someone make the lights go on and off in the houses?  Maybe they are off to start, then they come on after a set elapsed time once a zombie starts to attack...  and then an armed human (or knight) comes out to kill the zombies if the house is not destroyed after a set time after the lights come on.\n\n[ ] It would be nice to have the \"Game Over\" notice again.  Not sure where that went.\n\n[ ] I turned off the \"health bar\" over the houses until they are working.  They are still there, but just not active right now.\n\n[ ] Right now the houses disappear once the zombies attack.  Can this be changed to a house with the lights out instead?  Later we can replace it with a house that has broken windows and a broken door.\n\n[ ] Anyone who can figure out how to add some of our sound effects to the various actions in the game would make a huge difference.\n\n[ ] A new background image for the map (mad levels) would be great.  Something with some houses on it, a path, mountains, and a little castle at the end of the path to show the main goal.  James and I were able to download something from Google and replace the .png file with the new image...  it worked fairly well and revealed that it was possible.  But it was not from our game and was just a test scene, so we deleted it.  You can reference the map scene in \"Royal Revolt\" for ideas.\n\n[ ] Zooming in closer is really great.  Can we take the camera in even more?  I tried it on my phone and it is still fairly small and hard to see.  Also, the camera movement was extremely fast on my iPhone.  Can someone please port the game to an android device and see how it actually plays?\n"

  "readme_contents": "# About this project\n\nThe way scripts are categorized is based on their current functionality. \n***The objective of this project is to get as many scripts in the No Known Erorrs category.*** \nEventually, once scripts have been tested even more thoroughly there will be a new category for scripts that have parity with the original scripts.\n\n## What is the purpose of these scripts and what do I do with them?\n\nRecompileable scripts can be used to override the base game scripts so your scripts are used instead of the base game scripts. You would want to do this if you wanted to make custom gamemodes, change local variables, or delete functions.\n\n### The current categories are:\n\n**No Known Errors**: This means that during a short gameplay test no errors are observed.\nIt can also mean that the script is unused such as the _hackables series meaning that while they are being parsed nothing is calling them.\n\n**Minor Errors**: Indicates that the scripts are functional but perhaps there is a typo in text shown on screen or other ui error.\nIt means that while the script doesn't have 100% parity with the base script it nears 100% and all the expected core functionality of the script works.\n\n**Major Errors**: The scripts' core functionality is missing or broken so that anything from crashes occur during gameplay or perks not working.\nAny script categorized as having major errors is not yet in a playable state unlike scripts with only Minor or No Known Errors.\n\n**exe_client_field_mismatch**: This is a specific error that doesn't have a specific cause.\nScripts that cause this error will run serverside but clients cannot join due to this error.\n\n**Severe Errors**: Minidump, hang on map_rotate, crash, or other error that prevents the server from starting up is in this category.\nThis type of error can be caused by many different things\n\nEach script will be sorted by its location e.g. patch_zm/maps/mp/zombies check the markdown in each folder to see the current status of a script\n\n### Resources:\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this project first check out these resources that will help you in debugging decompiled scripts:\n\nhttps://github.com/Scobalula/Cerberus-Repo:\nThis is a decompiler that can decompile bo2 compiled scripts\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nwv3uGFwpopIMMXDVcZdG0iq2vQAVHc-?usp=sharing\nThis includes:\n```\nBo2 Dvars list\nFastFile extractor so you can extract .gscs for the cerberus decompiler to decompile\nBo3 decompiled scripts\nBo2 zombies decompiled scripts\nBo1 full dump\nAn older Bo2 gsc dump from its initial release has comments from developers\nGSC studio which has a built in compiler for bo2 scripting\n```\n\nThis is the black ops 2 beta dump\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rt3sAIoYhCgqhsotrElygta7-BXn-3ZM/view?usp=sharing\n\n"

Create DB named ZombieScore\r\n2. Create new user named \"zombieadmin\" with password \"freshmeat\".\r\n3. Grant read/write roles of ZombieScore DB to zombieadmin\r\n\r\n### Redis Setups\r\nNothing XD\r\n\r\n### Run the server\r\n1. You have to install Node.js dependencies first. Install via NPM:\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run the server.\r\n```bash\r\n$ node server\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Highly recommend to run server with PM2 or Forever module. The server must be run while you gameplaying.\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo npm install -g pm2\r\n$ pm2 start server.js --name \"ZombieScoreServer\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ok, just show me how\r\nOk, well.. Here's the video how to:\r\n\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eimqfonYaF8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eimqfonYaF8)\r\n\r\nClick the above image to redirect to youtube.\r\n\r\n\r\n### About authentication\r\nAuthentication system is just really simple, because it's focused on implementation, not for product ready state.\r\nWhen user logged in, server returns string token, and it saves into the server's local memory(Redis).\r\nAfter then user can access other APIs that requires authentication with that token.\r\nWhen user logged out, server will destroy that token.\r\n\r\nOh, I forgot to remove tokens when user just shutting down the client.\r\nIf you make something product inspired by these examples, don't forget to remove token after some specific times that user didn't anything.\r\n\r\nAlso in this demonstration, I didn't checked that user try to access while it's already logged in. You have to check this too.\r\n\r\nPlease don't tell me why you made this something this blabla, it's just demonstration XD\r\nI just focused on Logic itself, not perfection!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n- [Game Client](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defense-fps-multiplayer-example)\r\n- [Web Scoreboard](https://github.com/rico345100/unity-zombie-defense-fps-multiplayer-scoreboard)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Donate me\r\nAll my tutorials and projects are made for help people who want to learn.
