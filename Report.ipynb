    "We decided to use repositories that came up in a GitHub search for the word 'zombie'. We acquired the data using Zach Gulde's functions for acquiring data using GitHub's API as well as some functions defined by our group to acquire the names of the repositories. To prepare our data, we removed those repositories which had non-English characters. We then normalized, tokenized, stemmed, lemmatized, and removed stopwords from each README. Before moving on to our data exploration, we split our dataset into train, validate, and test samples."
